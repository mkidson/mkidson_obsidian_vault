The gang approached Wheelwatch Outpost and scouted it for a while. They used Owl Capone to scout out the number of soldiers and place mice in the horns to stop the alarm being raised. When they attacked, Zulo and Ooluz snuck close to the fortress, teleported Ooluz nearby, and then everyone ran in to attack. Ooluz started cranking the gate open after Owl Capone cast knock on the gate mechanism. They all managed to get in just in time to fight against the soldiers, but the dragonnel rising from the stables shocked them, and the gang now need to fight it. Initiative has been rolled, and shit is about to go down. 

- Want to research which spell scrolls to give to Zulo

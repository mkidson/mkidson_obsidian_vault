Before retiring to the village of Vogler, Ispin Greenshield traveled across Ansalon as a teacher, trader, and adventurer. Along the way, he forged friendships with each of the characters. Each character knows the following information about him:

- Ispin was a good-natured human adventurer from Solamnia.
- Ispin took his name from a distinctive green shield he found early in his adventuring career. He claimed the shield was magical, but it had no obvious magical properties.
- The bighearted Ispin loved telling tall tales of his travels to anyone who would listen.
- Ispin used to adventure with a human Knight of Solamnia named Becklin and a hill dwarf warrior named Cudgel. These two featured in many of Ispin’s stories of fighting sea monsters and goblin raiders.
- Ispin retired from traveling years ago, becoming a permanent resident of a little-known village in Solamnia called Vogler.  

The Meeting Ispin Greenshield table suggests a few ways characters might have come to know and likely respect Ispin. Players can elaborate on these connections however they’d like. Characters can use their relationship with Ispin to reinforce how they know one another.

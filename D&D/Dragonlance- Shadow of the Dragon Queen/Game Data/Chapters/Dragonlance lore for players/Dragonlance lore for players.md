The world has ended, and it’s ending again.

Three hundred years ago, the Cataclysm brought ruin to the world of Krynn. In a single day, an age of wonders came to an end. Countless innocents died, the face of the world was reshaped, and the gods themselves faded into legend. Through ages of struggle, the peoples of Krynn survived, but the world isn’t what it was. Those nations that remain linger in the shadows of their ancestors’ wonders. Only slowly have they begun to push back centuries of darkness and rediscover how the world has changed.

Then came the Dragon Armies, legions of soldiers devoted to the wicked god Takhisis the Dragon Queen, and the world faces ruin once more. The War of the Lance has begun, and in a conflict between gods and dragons, a wounded world hangs in the balance.

> “To the Council of Maelgoth:War is coming—that truth I can no longer deny. Here in Solamnia’s eastern reaches, rumors swirl of human-led armies on the march, their ranks swelled by hobgoblins, minotaurs, ogres, and mysterious hooded mercenaries, all seeking a share of the spoils. Our allies in Nordmaar have fallen silent, and desperate travelers say the people of Khur have joined the enemy en masse. Whispers also speak of winged doom, wild reports of riders on dragonnels—and I dare imagine worse.I don’t yet understand the shape of our enemy. Their motivations, their origins, and their very nature remain opaque. What is clear is that we face a threat unlike any since the Cataclysm. And when it comes, it will come for Kalaman.Good lieges, I pray you make overtures toward healing the old wounds between our order and the Beacon of the East. If we knights are to meet this threat, we need the sharp eyes and strong shields of Kalaman as allies.To aid your efforts, I have compiled my notes on the Kalaman region’s history, neighbors, and lore. I hope this knowledge proves useful in meeting the threat before us.Live with honor,Becklin Uth Viharin,Knight of the Crown”

# The History of Krynn

![[00-002.scholars.png]]

While every world’s history is vast and fractured, with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn’s tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since.

## Before the Cataclysm

Krynn’s earliest centuries have passed into mythohistory. The story begins in the Age of Starbirth when the gods forged the world from primordial chaos. This period’s records are mere legends and scriptures, and few credit their details as fact.

Next came the Age of Dreams, a time when heroes battled the forces of evil. Many modern cultures and institutions saw their origins in this era, including the Knights of Solamnia, the Mages of High Sorcery, and the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Ironically, these cultures often dismiss one another’s foundational stories as baseless myths while fiercely insisting on the veracity of their own.

During a terrible conflict known as the Third Dragon War, the knight Huma Dragonbane was granted the first of the fabled dragonlances. He used it to defeat the evil god Takhisis the Dragon Queen and end the war, forcing the god and her dragons to leave Krynn. The good dragons of Krynn soon departed as well, leaving the world to mortals and the remaining gods.

  

During the thousand years before the Cataclysm, known as the Age of Might, several human nations flourished, conquering vast swaths of the continent of Ansalon in the name of good. But the triumph of the Age of Might sowed the seeds of its downfall.

Over the centuries, the city of Istar in eastern Ansalon grew into a continent-spanning empire, thanks in part to a military alliance with the Knights of Solamnia. Istar came to be ruled by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and themselves the holy messengers of the gods of good. Under their leadership, Istar declared war on actions, peoples, and even thoughts that the kingpriests considered evil. Increasingly rigid and theocratic, Istar reached its apex of power just before its apocalyptic fall. The last kingpriest undertook ever more audacious magical feats, culminating in a ritual to attain godhood and rule Krynn forever in the name of good. At last, the gods acted, united in their condemnation of Istar.

## The Cataclysm

As a last effort to avoid mass destruction, the gods sent the Thirteen Warnings, a series of signs meant to deter the kingpriest. Trees wept blood, fires raged unnaturally, and cyclones struck the gleaming Temple of the Kingpriest. The gods also warned a few chosen mortals, reasoning that if any of them reached Istar and prevented the ritual, the world might not be beyond redemption. But the messengers failed—the kingpriest and his followers dismissed the warnings as the work of evil and continued on their path. As the hour of the kingpriest’s ritual to attain godhood arrived, the gods whisked away their most devout followers and unleashed punishment on all who remained.

A mountain of fire fell from the sky, destroying Istar. The Blood Sea—a new ocean that split eastern Ansalon—consumed the empire. Coastlines shifted all over the world, sundering nations, drowning whole regions, and stranding ports miles from the sea. Though some lands escaped the worst of the destruction, none were spared divine wrath.

The gods and their blessings then faded from the world, and in time, even their names were all but forgotten.

  

> [!important]  
> “The Cataclysm! It looms larger than any other event in the history of our world, forever dividing time into before and after. Even our calendar reflects this, marking our last four chaotic centuries in years After Cataclysm (AC), while the millennia before, stretching back into shrouded myth, are Pre-Cataclysm (PC).Many records of the time before the Cataclysm are lost to us. Those that do survive are often perplexing, referencing nations and cultures that no longer exist and geography that has changed beyond recognition.Still, it is possible to piece these scattered sources together. At the request of the good knights of Maelgoth, here are my notes, compiling a rough introduction to the histories recorded here at the Great Library of Palanthas.Nikkas of Palanthas, Assistant to the Librarian”  

![[00-003.nikkas-letter.png]]

  

## After the Cataclysm

The Cataclysm ushered in a period of chaos. During the next three centuries, known as the Time of Darkness, cultures and ecologies were radically altered, causing famine, plague, and mass migrations. The Knights of Solamnia, the champions who might’ve kept Ansalon united, were distrusted as former allies of Istar and persecuted across the continent, even in Solamnia.

The elven nations shut their borders. The dwarves of Thorbardin withdrew to their deep tunnels, refusing entrance to refugees from the surface. Many societies turned on one another or fell to disease and war. Nations of hobgoblins and ogres spread, capitalizing on humanity’s decline and claiming whole regions. Much that survived the Cataclysm was lost in darkness.

At length, the worst effects of the disaster waned. Though many elves and mountain dwarves remained reclusive, other cultures tentatively rebuilt. Explorers ventured forth to map the drastically altered continent. Societies reestablished bonds of trade that united and diversified them.

As the civilizations of Krynn rebuilt, and new societies arose, the world learned to live with a jarring truth: the gods were truly gone. Religion on Krynn was altered forever. True clerics, who once worked miracles on behalf of their gods, had vanished. While some people remained devout, many others turned to false religions in search of answers and comfort. Some of these new faiths were founded by charlatans, others by zealots. Some claimed the names of the gods, others dismissed them entirely. In this radically changed world bereft of immortal insight, truth became subject to conjecture, even among Krynn’s most dedicated scholars.

# Life on Ansalon

This story takes place on the continent of Ansalon. There are many lands and cultures on Krynn that are not represented here.

Here are a few details regarding everyday life on Ansalon.

## Languages

Across Ansalon, language is an expression of upbringing and exposure. Before the Cataclysm, Common served as a language of commerce under the empires of Ergoth, Solamnia, and Istar. After the Cataclysm, migrating refugees communicated using Common, and today it’s spoken in every corner of the continent. Nevertheless, the local languages of most lands still flourish, and Common is used primarily in markets and in dealings with travelers.

With the DM’s approval, players can exchange a language granted by their characters’ race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Ansalon table or the Rare Languages of Ansalon table.

### Standard Languages of Ansalon

## Currency

Since the Cataclysm, the harsh realities of daily survival leave little room for impracticality. For years after the devastation, steel’s value skyrocketed until it was valued as highly as gold, thanks to the difficulty of forging steel and its obvious practical applications. Similarly, bronze was valued on par with silver. While the value of steel and bronze has diminished to pre-Cataclysm standards, trade coins of bronze and steel remain in use across Ansalon.

|**Coin**|**CP**|**BP/SP**|**GP/STL**|**PP**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Copper (CP)|1|1/10|1/100|1/1,000|
|Bronze (BP) or Silver (SP)|10|1|1/10|1/100|
|Gold (GP) or Steel (STL)|100|10|1|1/10|
|Platinum (PP)|1,000|100|10|1|

# Kalaman Region

Situated in the province of Nightlund in Solamnia’s eastern reaches, Kalaman is one of the nation’s most vital gateways to the outside world. The city, known as the Beacon of the East, rises along a deepwater port near the mouth of the Vingaard River, Solamnia’s greatest trade artery. Blessed with the bounty of the river, the benefits of trade, and the fertile soil of the Solamnic plains, the Kalaman region flourished even after the Cataclysm.

## City of Kalaman

Kalaman began as a sleepy fishing village on the coast of the Turbidus Ocean. It might have remained so if not for the arrival of an Istarian trading mission centuries before the Cataclysm. Seeing the potential of a deep harbor so close to the mouth of a great river, the Empire of Istar invested heavily in the town, transforming it into a thriving trade hub. Solamnia soon found Istar’s stranglehold on the booming port intolerable, and after a climactic battle on the plains west of the city, Istar ceded control of Kalaman.

Today, long after the fall of Istar and the trials of the Cataclysm, Kalaman remains a thriving port city surrounded by tall Istarian-built walls that have never been breached. In its busy harbor, vessels from all over Ansalon go about their business under the light of the city’s two grand beacons, pre-Cataclysm marvels that have survived for generations. At the center of the city, the ancient Castle Kalaman rises intimidatingly on a sheer hill. The castle’s architectural marvels include defenses yet to be recreated in the modern age.

## People of Kalaman

The city of Kalaman is notably cosmopolitan, while most people in surrounding communities make their livelihood through fishing and farming. Many of the region’s inhabitants are Solamnic humans, while others descend from the city’s Istarian founders. Traders from all over Ansalon settle in Kalaman through preference or necessity. As a result, some humans hail or have ancestors from Abanasinia, Nordmaar, Ergoth, Estwilde, and farther-flung lands. Kender, hill dwarves, and gnomes are common in the region, while some elves, mountain dwarves, and other people also make their home in the city. Anyone is welcome in Kalaman if they come peaceably with goods to trade.

## Surrounding Regions

To the west of the Kalaman region lies Hinterlund. Even farther west lie the Plains of Solamnia, from where crops and crafted goods make their way to Kalaman for trade. Even in parts of Solamnia closer to the port of Palanthas, it’s often cheaper and easier to move goods down the river to Kalaman.

North of Kalaman, the grasslands characteristic of Solamnia give way to the broken steppes and labyrinthine canyons known as the Northern Wastes. Deadly beasts, treacherous cliffs, and unpredictable flooding make the wastes a dangerous land where it’s said nothing survives for long.

East of Kalaman, the lands of Estwilde hold inhospitable terrain and peoples who have been unfriendly to Solamnia since the days of Istar. Across the bay in northern Estwilde lie the swamps of Qwalmish. To the south and east of Kalaman are the rolling steppes of Qlettaar, which in turn give way to the forbidding peaks of the Taman Busuk region beyond Estwilde.

## Nightlund

For generations, the Soths of Dargaard Keep—a family of Knights of Solamnia—ruled the Solamnic province once known as Knightlund. Before the Cataclysm, the gods of good forewarned Knightlund’s leader, Lord Loren Soth, about the coming destruction and offered him a chance to stop it, but he failed to accomplish this task. Since then, the province has had a cursed reputation. People have come to know the land as Nightlund and ascribe the region’s frequent storms to the old gods’ disfavor.

---

# Religion and the Gods

The gods of Krynn are said to have abandoned the world, and in the great cities of Ansalon, temples and centers of faith are few. Nevertheless, small miracles occur across the world. Druids and hidden communities offer prayers in the old ways and employ mysterious magic. Long-lived peoples remember the worship of the gods and see their shapes in nature and the constellations above. Ancient, forgotten sanctuaries hold wonders beyond imagination, and divine whispers reach those with the minds and hearts to listen. The gods haven’t wholly abandoned Krynn, and as threats grow, mortals turn to them once more—sometimes after a remarkable encounter with a messenger of the gods.

The gods of Krynn loosely align with one another along the principles of good, neutrality, and evil. While such alliances can be tenuous, the gods often work together to enact their shared will across the world or to oppose unions of their foes. The Deities of Krynn table and the following sections summarize the gods most active in the world. Among Krynn’s diverse lands and peoples, gods take various names, genders, and forms. Those presented in the following sections are the representations best known in Solamnia.

> [!important]  
> It’s easy to blame the gods for the Cataclysm. They sent the Thirteen Warnings and the burning mountain that followed. They sank Istar beneath the waves, shattered the continent, and withdrew from the world. They chose to cause the immense suffering of the disaster and the centuries since.But let us suppose that the gods of good love this world and want us to flourish. That the gods of neutrality strive to steward and uphold the agency of mortals. That even the gods of evil, selfish as they are, seek power and influence, not destruction for its own sake. Why, then, would they punish us with the Cataclysm and leave us in a godless world?I fear we’ve forgotten more than we remember. Worship of the true gods is ever waning, and false religions rise in their place. I pray every day that we’ve learned our lesson—that the gods will return, and that I may cede this chair to one who hears their voices and bears their true blessings.Time alone will tell.Rosamund Heward, Knight of the CrownActing High Clerist  

## Gods of Good

The gods of good provide healing and comfort to the mortals of Krynn. Although they oppose the evil gods’ attempts to rule the world, their goal isn’t the eradication of evil or its gods. Rather, their highest pursuit is preserving mortal choice, despite the sorrowful knowledge that mortals sometimes choose ruinous paths.

![[00-031.good-god-symbols.png]]

Symbols Left to Right: Paladine, Branchala, and Habbakuk

### Paladine

Paladine is known as the Father of Good, the Master of Law, the Platinum Dragon, and—on other worlds of the multiverse—Bahamut. He leads the gods of good and watches over the world with an eye toward order, justice, and mercy. He teaches that wise and just laws are the basis of a functioning society, and his clerics often aid in crafting and upholding such laws.

### Branchala

Called the Bard King, Branchala is the god of music, poetry, and the inner beauty of all living things. Many elves and kender worship him above all other gods. Both groups revere him as a champion of life and laughter, bringing solace and joy to those who listen.

### Habbakuk

Habbakuk, known as the Fisher King, oversees animal life, the sea, and the balance of nature. Many sailors, farmers, and hunters revere him. His holy sites are often marked with the image of a blue bird or a phoenix wreathed in blue flames.

### Kiri-Jolith

Kiri-Jolith is the god of righteous war. He blesses all who fight in the name of good and scorns those who delight in slaughter and lust for battle. He is particularly revered by the Knights of the Sword, an order of the Knights of Solamnia that seeks to root out evil wherever it dwells.

![[00-038.o-good-trio.png]]

Symbols Left to Right: Kiri-Jolith, Majere, and Mishakal

### Majere

Austere and aloof, Majere is the god of meditation and discipline. Monks, his most devoted followers, honor him by leading lives of quiet contemplation in remote monasteries. Many orphans are raised in the monasteries of Majere; some become monks themselves, while those who leave the monastic life often take the surname Majere out of respect.

### Mishakal

God of compassion, healing, and love, Mishakal is widely worshiped by healers and community guardians. Throughout history, she has reached out to chosen heroes to soothe others’ suffering. Her faithful offer healing and solace to all—even enemies.

### Solinari

Solinari, the god of good magic, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order of the White Robes and other benevolent mages. His power manifests through the white moon of Krynn, the brightest of its three moons. Along with his cousins Lunitari and Nuitari, he watches Krynn from the heavens and encourages magic that aids, heals, and protects.

![[00-016.symbol-solinari.png]]

Symbol of Solinari

## Gods of Neutrality

The neutral gods of Krynn vary widely in their motivations and methods. Some are passive and distant, dedicated to recording the actions of mortals or upholding the balance between societies and nature. Others take a more active hand, injecting elements of chaos and innovation into mortal life. Unlike the gods of good and evil, the neutral gods have little interest in the struggle over mortal destinies.

![[00-033.neutral-god-symbols.png]]

Symbols Left to Right: Gilean, Chislev, and Lunitari

### Gilean

The god of knowledge and nominal leader of the neutral gods, Gilean embodies the ideal of neutrality. He stands back and observes, recording all that unfolds. Gilean is keeper of the Tobril, a book said to contain all the knowledge of the gods, though portions are sealed to all but Gilean. Some people believe the scribe Astinus of Palanthas to be Gilean in human form.

### Chislev

Chislev is the god of nature on its own terms, governing the rhythms of life that unfold heedless of mortal action. Though enigmatic and shy, they are fiercely protective of their domain, regarding all plants and animals as their children. Chislev’s followers are often hermits, druids, and others who revere nature without asking anything in return.

### Lunitari

Lunitari, the god of neutral magic and illusions, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order of the Red Robes and other neutral mages. With her cousins Solinari and Nuitari, she watches over the people of Krynn from the heavens, conveying her power through the red moon that shares her name. She appears as a trickster figure in mythology, using her mastery of illusions to fool gods and heroes alike.

### Reorx

Reorx is the god of creation, inspiration, and artisanship, credited with creating the gnomes, dwarves, kender, and even Krynn itself. He invents new things that alter the world and spur its people to action.

![[00-039.o-neutral-trio.png]]

Symbols Left to Right: Reorx, Shinare, and Sirrion

### Shinare

Shinare is the god of wealth, industry, and commerce. Though many of her followers are merchants, her influence spans legitimate and underhanded commerce alike, and she receives occasional worship from thieves. Despite this, most consider her a god of fair dealing; supplicants pray she favors them as they bargain.

### Sirrion

Passionate and impulsive, Sirrion is the god of alchemy, transformation, serendipitous creation, and flames. He embodies momentary excitement, flaring quickly into fiery passion and smoldering long afterward. Sirrion’s followers embrace extremes of emotion as forms of divine expression.

### Zivilyn

Where Gilean embodies knowledge, Zivilyn exemplifies the calm wisdom necessary to wield knowledge in the world. He’s said to exist in all times and places, possessing the collected wisdom of every plane of existence. Zivilyn often attracts the worship of eccentrics, philosophers, and sages.

![[00-023.symbol-zivilyn.png]]

Symbol of Zivilyn

## Gods of Evil

The evil gods of Krynn embody power, vengeance, and other ideals that elevate self above community. They wish to rule the mortal world, believing only they are worthy of such dominion. They rely on temptation and subjugation to secure the service of lesser creatures. In every age, some mortals are willing to sell their souls for power, and the gods of evil are eager to oblige.

![[00-035.evil-god-symbols.png]]

Symbols Left to Right: Takhisis, Chemosh, and Hiddukel

### Takhisis

Takhisis, leader of Krynn’s evil gods, is known as the Dragon Queen, the Queen of Darkness, and—on other worlds—Tiamat. She is the god of power, pride, and control, as well as the queen of chromatic dragons. She tempts mortals to her service with offers of dominance over others. Barred from Krynn since before the Cataclysm, she found her chance to return in the centuries that followed. She sometimes appears as a powerful human warrior with gleaming armor and long black hair, but her true form is a five-headed dragon.

### Chemosh

Chemosh is the god of undeath and false redemption, tempting his followers with the promise of immortality. Those who heed him find that while they may live forever, their bodies still decay and putrefy. Followers of Chemosh embrace his baleful reputation, dressing in white skull masks and black robes.

### Hiddukel

Hiddukel is the god of greed and treachery. He holds domain over all ill-gotten wealth in the world, and criminals and unscrupulous traders worship him in secret. While Hiddukel gladly accepts their worship, his true goal is the acquisition not of riches, but of souls.

### Morgion

Solitary and secretive, Morgion is the god of disease and decay. He doesn’t consult or act in accord with the other gods, preferring to brood in his otherworldly fortress, the Bronze Tower, and pursue his own schemes. His worshipers follow his example, meeting in the dark and maintaining secrecy in all things.

![[00-040.o-evil-trio.png]]

Symbols Left to Right: Morgion, Nuitari, and Sargonnas

### Nuitari

Nuitari, the god of evil magic and darkness, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order of the Black Robes and other wicked mages. He encourages selfish and destructive magic. His power flows through the black moon that shares his name, which is visible only due to the stars it blocks in the sky.

### Sargonnas

Sargonnas is the unpredictable god of flame, vengeance, and wrath. Though he’s a consort to Takhisis, he schemes against her as often as he fights on her behalf. He is worshiped by those who seek retribution. His true form is that of a monstrous minotaur, and many minotaurs revere him under the name Sargas.

### Zeboim

Zeboim is the god of the ocean in its destructive aspect, including storms and dangerous sea creatures. She is a mercurial god, and even her followers aren’t safe from her frequent bouts of rage. Most sailors pray to Habbakuk to keep Zeboim at bay, but some make offerings to Zeboim to allay her wrath.

Bakaris (neutral evil, human noble) shares the same name as his father, his father’s father, and so on for generations. Bakaris places inordinate value on his good looks, fashionable clothes, and athleticism, but he’s known more for his arrogance, pettiness, and short temper. He cares nothing for his family name, but he defers to his father—partly from unbroken childhood habit, and partly because all his privilege depends on his father’s wealth. Bakaris also has a violent streak. While living in Estwilde, he murdered the son of a local leader during a duel, and he and his father to Vogler to escape the consequences. Bakaris takes quiet pride in that killing, and he fantasizes about one day winning respect via the point of his sword. He loathes being called “the Younger,” a diminutive his father encourages.

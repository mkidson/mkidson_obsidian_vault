## Knowledge of Kalaman

Characters who are from Kalaman or who succeed on a **DC 12 Intelligence (History)** check know the following.

**Capital City.** Kalaman is the capital of the Solamnic province of Nightlund.

**Ancient Bastion.** Kalaman is a thriving trade city known for its strong walls, castle, and harbor beacons, all of which predate the Cataclysm.

**Rulers.** The city is led by a governor, a council of prominent guild leaders, and a military marshal.

**Military.** Kalaman maintains a significant military force to deter raiders from Estwilde and monsters from the Dargaard Mountains.

**Vingaard Port.** The city sits at the mouth of the Vingaard River, about thirty miles downriver from Vogler.

## Power in Kalaman

Kalaman is led by the following three groups:

**Governor.** The head of Kalaman’s government is Governor Calof Miat (lawful neutral, human [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble)). He represents the city’s people and speaks on their behalf during council sessions.

**Guild Leaders.** A council composed of the leaders of the city’s five most prominent guilds—the Cartographers’ Guild, Dockhands’ Guild, Fishers’ Guild, Masons’ Guild, and Shipwrights’ Guild—oversees the city’s broad business interests and runs varied public services. The guilds’ leaders are neutral human and hill dwarf [nobles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16966-noble) who are prone to bickering and jockeying for influence.

**Marshal.** Kalaman’s military guards the city and defends eastern Solamnia. The military is robust, as the city can’t afford to solicit aid from the Knights of Solamnia, headquartered in the west, every time raiders from Estwilde or other threats cross the border. Kalaman’s military is commanded by the pragmatic Marshal Nestra Vendri (lawful neutral, human [knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16938-knight)).

## Kalaman Locations

### Castle Kalaman

A symbol of the city, the age-old fortress of Castle Kalaman rises atop rugged cliffs, visible from anywhere within the city walls and for miles beyond. The city’s governor dwells within the castle, and the ruling council holds its meetings here. Castle Kalaman also serves as the headquarters of Kalaman’s military, and its barracks can house hundreds of troops. Extensive catacombs run beneath Castle Kalaman, but the entrances to these tunnels were closed long ago and remain magically sealed.

### City Market

Merchants from across Ansalon do business in Kalaman’s thriving bazaar. Characters can purchase any equipment from the Player’s Handbook here. Vendors from far-off lands—like Ergoth or Mount Nevermind—often bring rare curios here to trade.

### Hammerstrike Forges

Twin forges stand across the street from one another, run by the dwarven cousins Kadmos and Tiria Hammerstrike (both lawful neutral, hill dwarf veterans). While both are competent smiths, Kadmos specializes in armour and Tiria excels with weaponry.

### Harbour Beacons

The walls of Kalaman extend several hundred feet into the city’s harbour. The tower at each end holds a prominent beacon surrounded by an array of lenses. These beacons were created before the Cataclysm by the city’s Istarian founders, and the light from their flames cuts through the densest fog.

### Kalaman Harbour

At any time, dozens of ships are anchored along the busy docks of Kalaman’s harbour. Small local fishing ships vie for harbor space alongside mighty seafaring vessels, some from far-off lands. Every day there’s a 10 percent chance a merchant ship from a distant land puts into port here, its crew eager to sell unique wares and tell tales of danger on the sea.

### Meulara’s Oddities

Meulara’s Oddities is a small shop piled with trinkets. Its shopkeeper, Meulara (chaotic good, kender commoner (aussie accent)), is a silver-haired woman with a bright smile. Meulara claims to know every kender in the city, and most kender new to town are directed to her so they can swap stories and news from their travels.

### The Steady Beacon

The Steady Beacon is a tavern that boasts a large taproom, a fish-focused menu, and modest lodging. Its decor features the broken weapons of defeated bandits. The tavern is a favourite of Kalaman’s soldiers, and most evenings, dozens of off-duty troops relax here. The inn’s owner, Jesen Thold (neutral good, human veteran), is a friend of Marshal Nestra Vendri, head of Kalaman’s military.

On the wall behind the bar is a chalkboard sporting the various drink and lodging prices, as well as a large number 4 written on the right hand side. A few of the tables are occupied by what look to be locals: fishermen, farmers, dockworkers etc. Some travellers sit alone or in small groups, and a young woman plays the lute in the corner, occasionally stopping to chat with patrons and eat food taken to her by the barkeep. **This is Margo Thold, daughter of the inn’s owner Jesen.**

In the corner sits someone in a worn, black cloak. Their hood is up and a half-full mug of ale sits in front of them. Regulars occasionally look towards them and then shake their head and go back to their conversation.

|Item|Cost|
|---|---|
|Ale (gallon)|2 sp|
|Ale (mug)|4 cp|
|Banquet (per person)|10 gp|
|Bread, loaf|2 cp|
|Cheese, hunk|1 sp|
|Meat, chunk|3 sp|
|Wine, common (pitcher)|2 sp|
|Wine, fine (bottle)|10 gp|
|Day’s Lodging (modest)|5 sp|
|Day’s Lodging (comfortable)|8 sp|

### Trade Camps

Outside the city to the east and west sprawl trade camps. These expanses of ramshackle buildings began as campgrounds for caravans. Over time, the tents were replaced by simple buildings aligned along muddy streets. They now house hundreds who can’t find lodgings within the city’s walls.

# Retcon!!!!

The characters recall seeing a large dragon-shaped thing being led into the town as they boarded the last boat and left. They initially thought it was an actual dragon, but that is of course ridiculous as the dragons left Krynn at the time of the Cataclysm. After some intense peering, they realised that it is some sort of contraption made to look like a dragon. It looks to be constructed in the same manner and style as the gnomeflinger atop Becklin’s keep, as well as other gnomish inventions they may have seen. It is extremely effective at setting fire to things and could be a dangerous weapon. Becklin and Cudgel look very worried about it and speak about informing the Kalaman leaders about it.

# Reminder

Remind them about the scrolls they received from Rovina at the Trial of the Barb. She told them not to open the scrolls, that their contents were for Wyhan only.

# Prelude

We need some way for Cudgel and Becklin to leave the others behind. My though is to make them go to Solamnia to warn the Knights. Becklin wants to go alone but Cudgel insists that now that the Ironclad regiment is gone, she has nothing left so will accompany Becklin for safety.

> [!important]  
> Play the funeral music again :)  
  
> [!important]  
> On the last boat out of Vogler sits the five of you. Daethia, Xoe, Zulo, Oooluz, and Rho’lah. With you is Becklin, Cudgel, Mayor Raven, and Jeyev (Cudgel’s Lieutenant). In the distance, Vogler burns. The smoke rises from the home of a people you came to be quite fond of in your short time in the town. The Red Dragon Army rides amongst it, victorious. You notice that Becklin looks concerned and fidgety, and with a quick inspection realise that she keeps looking down at what she’s sitting on. You realise you didn’t notice it before, but she’s sat atop a fairly large wooden box. Thinking back you realise she was late to join the boats because she had returned to her keep to fetch something, and that must be this box, with no markings except a kingfisher emblazoned on the top. Becklin’s gaze seems to be shifting from Vogler, to the box, to you five, to the rest of the makeshift flotilla carrying Vogler’s people towards Kalaman.After an hour or so of travelling down the river, with only the glow of the blaze visible now, Becklin clears her throat:”I fear I must leave you all. Someone must bring this news to the Knights of Solamnia and I feel I am the one to do it. Let me get out at the next possible spot and I will travel to the west in search of them. You all must go to Kalaman and warn their army to of this attack and of the weapons they used. This is incredibly important.”  

Cudgel will immediately offer to go with Becklin and won’t take no for an answer. The way will be dangerous and she feels an obligation. The characters can then discuss with Becklin whatever they wish. Once the decision has been made, Becklin will then look to the box and say

> [!important]  
> “Please, give this to Darrett when you can. I wish I could give it to him myself but time is of the essence.”  

The others in the boat look curious about what’s in the box but don’t pry.

Soon after, a spot comes up on the south side of the river. The boat is steered towards it and Becklin and Cudgel get out. **An easy insight** check tells the players that they know this is dangerous, as they will have to go back towards the army. They say their goodbyes and push the boat out into the river before walking off into the darkness. The boat continues its journey down the river.

---

# Kalaman

> [!important]  
> As dawn begins to break, you see the walled city of Kalaman silhouetted by the rising sun. It spreads across the southern shore of a wide bay, with ships sailing to and from the city’s walled harbour. The entrance to the harbour is lit by a pair of towering beacons. On the shore ahead, a few miles outside the walls of the city, the villagers have pulled their boats ashore and have begun to make some form of a camp with what little supplies they could take with them.  

## Arriving on the shore

The players are among the last to land at the camp, having caught up to the group in the night.

**GIVE THIS ONE TO XOE OR OOLUZ**

As they arrive, either someone calls out or they spot a boat of youngsters struggling to land their boat. They’ve had one go but were bashed against the rocks and lost their oars. They float out into the river, soon to be taken out into the bay. What do you do?

The boat is about 20 feet from the shore. A character that gets to the boat with an oar can pilot it by succeeding on a **DC 14 Wisdom (Survival)** check. Other solutions are available.

Once this has been resolved, they can all get to the shore.

> [!important]  
> LET GREG OR DAETHIA DO THIS ONEYou see a young couple sitting beside an unlit stack of firewood. You recognise the man as one of the men that competed alongside you in the fishing competition. You recall his name is Bram and that he spoke of his wife, Chelo, while fishing, saying how proud she would be of him if he won. The joy once on his face is now gone as he and Chelo stare off in the direction of Vogler. They’re shivering, the fire seemingly forgotten in their daze. Would you like to help them?  

---

### Darrett’s Armour

Darrett soon finds the group and asks after Becklin, knowing she would’ve been on the last boat out. Let the characters explain what she told them and hand over the large box.

If he opens it immediately, describe the following:

> [!important]  
> Inside is a suit of plate armour filigreed with Solamnic knotwork, seemingly perfectly sized for Darrett’s use. There’s no note or any instructions.  

Darrett is touched and thanks the characters profusely. From this point on he wears the armour often and does his best to act in the way that Becklin has taught him. He will don the armour after accepting the offer from the Governor.

---

### Delegation to Kalaman

Whoever has the highest passive perception realises that Lord Bakaris and his son are missing from the camp. If they ask around, a villager who arrived early mentions that they headed to Kalaman hours ago, talking of addressing the city’s leaders and launching a retaliation on the Dragon Army. Nobody has heard back from them. Mayor Raven discusses with the characters that she would go but she needs to be here for the townspeople at this moment, and hopes the party will go and secure the safety of the people of Vogler. Darrett will go with them.

---

### Entrance to Kalaman

It’s a few miles to Kalaman from the camp, which should take about an hour at a normal pace or half an hour at a fast pace.

> [!important]  
> As you approach the large walled city, some details become clearer. Statues of titanic soldiers line Kalaman’s mighty walls. These ancient stone knights stare into the distance, daring invaders to dash themselves against the defenses that withstood even the Cataclysm. A disorganised neighbourhood of tents and ramshackle structures lines the road to the city’s nearest gate. Soldiers in blue-and-yellow uniforms question all who enter.  

The guards stop the party and ask their business, but are quite casual about letting them in as long as the characters aren’t hostile.

If anyone asks about Lord Bakaris or a representative from Vogler, the guards point the way to Castle Kalaman. They recall their captain leading a man matching Bakaris’s description to the castle some time ago.

The castle is easy to navigate to as it looms about the city on 100-foot-high cliffs. The guards can also direct the characters to any place on the map that they ask about.

---

## Castle Kalaman

If they head straight to the castle:

> [!important]  
> As you wind your way through the large city, ahead of you looms the large Castle Kalaman, ever in your sights. Even if the imposing structure didn’t stand atop hundred-foot cliffs, it would still tower over every other structure in the city. The path to it rises up the cliffside, overlooked by gigantic statues matching those that line the city’s walls. At the path’s end, guards stand before an open gate.  

The guards ask their business again. If they explain that they’re representatives of Vogler, a guard leads them across a courtyard toward a council chamber where Lord Bakaris is speaking with the city council. The guard’s name was Hadrian, not pronounced like the emperor.

> [!important]  
> As you cross the paved courtyard, a familiar figure intercepts you with an arrogant smile. With his fancy clothes and neatly groomed hair, you recognise Bakaris the Younger.  

Use a posh English voice.

> [!important]  
> “My father has matters well in hand. We’ll be sure to send for you and the rest of them fish-folk once we’ve determined what’s best for them.”  

Bakaris

- Insists to the guard that the characters shouldn’t be allowed to disturb his father’s audience with the council.
- He’s not just a bully, but an active threat to those in need.
- He and his father are putting their own ambitions before the needs of the people of Vogler.

A character can try intimidate Bakaris with a **DC10 Charisma (Intimidation)** check, or try convince the guard to ignore Bakaris with a **DC14 Charisma (Persuasion)** check.

Bakaris hurls weak insults and slinks off.

> [!important]  
> - Your mothers never loved you!- Well you’ve clearly never had much wealth!- I could best any of you in a formal duel, any day of the week!https://endless-aetherium.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling_Rules  

---

### Council Meeting

The guard escorts the characters inside and explains to the council who they are.

> [!important]  
> You see before you eight serious-looking people sitting around a broad table in the middle of a spacious hall. At the table’s end, a tall man with plaited blond hair and a velvet vest of blue and gold stands to greet you. ”Welcome, guests. I am Governor Calof Miat. Your leader here has briefed us on the situation in Vogler, his bold defense, and your eagerness to strike back against these invaders.”As he says this he nods towards Lord Bakaris, who clearly looks very annoyed at your intrusion. ”Tell us, are your people still preparing for battle?”  

Other than Calof and Bakaris, there are 5 noble-looking humans and dwarves and one human woman wearing armour.

Now let the characters respond. Calof will act confused but won’t show any preference to Bakaris or the characters. He just wants to know what’s actually going on.

- If the topic of retaking Vogler comes up, Bakaris will support it, wanting to win glory for him and his family.
- Darrett is opposed to this, wanting to secure the safety of the villagers.
- For now, the council simply wants to gain more information about the enemy before thinking of attacking. They might ask about what types of forces they have and if they have any weapons that may be dangerous.
- Bakaris will contradict most of what the characters say but it’s all hot air. If they want to silence him, they can role play and possibly roll **Charisma (Intimidation)** to beat **DC 14**.

Once it has all been explained, read the following.

> [!important]  
> Governer Miat frowns. “This is all dire news. My heart goes out to your friends and families, but I hope you can understand our reticence to welcome you all through our city’s gates. These aren’t exactly normal times. Marshal?”The Governer gestures to the stern-looking woman wearing armour embellished with the blue and gold colours of Kalaman. She nods, stands up, and begins, “I am Marshal Vendri, commander of Kalaman’s military forces. I’m afraid your situation is far from unique.”  

---

### Kalaman’s Concerns

Vendri will share the following information:

- Small villages and farms to the south and east of Kalaman have been burned in recent weeks.
- Vogler is the largest community to be attacked, and the only one with many, if any, survivors.
- Experienced patrols of Kalaman soldiers have been found cut down, in some cases with mysterious clawlike gashes in their armour.
- Lord Bakaris and the characters have provided the clearest information on the enemy that Kalaman has received to date.
- Everyone has been hearing of the war in the eastern nation of Khur, but nobody thought that it might become relevant here so quickly.

Let them continue to discuss details. Vendri will be particularly interested in details about the draconians or the soldiers, as well as weapons such as the dragon fire thing.

Once this conversation comes to an end, the governor will ask the characters and Darrett to step outside while the council discusses what they’ve learned. Bakaris is not asked to leave.

---

### Awaiting a Decision

They are ushered into the hall outside the council chamber and begin to hear muffled conversation inside that they can’t immediately decipher. Bakaris the younger may be seen sulking in a corner, trying to look regal.

Darrett will re-emphasise how important it is for Vogler’s people to have Kalaman’s support and protection.

If anyone listens to the door, a **DC 14 Wisdom (Perception)** check will reveal a frustrated Marshal Vendri repeatedly interrupt Lord Bakaris.

About 30 minutes go by.

---

### Kalaman’s Decision

> [!important]  
> The chamber’s doors open and most of the council members file past you without a glance. Marshal Vendri beckons to you all from the door and as you enter you see the Governor and Lord Bakaris sat at the table. The Governor offers for you to sit.  
  
> [!important]  
> In a decisive tone, Governor Miat says “The citizens of Kalaman are prepared to offer your people shelter in the neighbourhoods outside the city walls, the protection of our soldiers, and - while we can spare it - food from our tables.” He folds his hands and fixes his eyes on you. “There is a condition, though.”  

He explains the following points:

- Kalaman’s leaders are concerned about the threat of the Dragon Army.
- They have woefully little information about the army, with the scouts they sent having disappeared.
- The characters have faced this foe and survived their attack.
- In return for protecting the villagers, the council want the characters and Darrett to report to Marshal Vendri as special operatives in the Kalaman military.

Let them discuss this offer. Vendri will provide clarifications if needed:

- Only one of the characters needs to swear themself in order for the deal to work, though all are welcome and it may work best if all do. This will also only be until the threat is over, however long that takes.
- Sworn characters will become esquires of Kalaman and be paid 5 GP per week.
- Sworn characters and their companions will receive free lodging at Castle Kalaman.
- Sworn characters will be given a palm-sized emblem with the blue-and-gold symbol of Kalaman etched into its face. This is a symbol of their special rank, which is akin to lieutenancy (higher than soldiers but lower than commanders).

If the characters all refuse, Darrett will ask to speak with them for a moment. He plans to accept the offer and will attempt to persuade the others to join him. He wants to not only aid the Vogler people, but counter the terrifying threat of the Dragon Army. If they still all refuse, he will offer to be the liaison with the military, and they can work as aides but not be formally employed.

If they accept, Governor Miat is pleased and goes off, talking to an assistant organising food and shelter for the villagers.Vendri dispatches guards to help the refugees relocate to just outside the Trade Gate.

Vendri tells the characters to ensure the refugees are safe and settled, and to familiarise themselves with the city, before meeting her in her office on the second floor of Castle Kalaman when they’re ready to learn more about their position and their first duties.

---

### Reporting Back

Mayor Raven spots the party as they enter the camp by the river and goes to meet them. She asks what the outcome was, and thanks them profusely (if they succeeded lol). After hearing that some are joining the military, she says that she and some of Vogler’s militia plan to offer their assistance as well.

She also asks that they simply call her Raven now, as long as Vogler is in Dragon Army hands.

If they ask about Bakaris, she hasn’t seen them but they are paying for rooms at the Steady Beacon.

---

### Reinforcements

A couple hours later, several wagons and a contingent of Kalaman soldiers reach the camp with food and supplies. They aid those in need first, but eventually help everyone to relocate to an unoccupied group of simple wooden buildings north of the Trade Gate. The villagers find dry, safe housing and pitch in to make everyone comfortable. There’s a communal cookhouse, led of course by Yalme (human woman), from the Brass Crab, and Elthar (human man that most call “Uncle”), from the Fish bowl. There is also an infirmary.

Darrett will encourage the characters to come up with some things they can do to help the people, perhaps using magic or just using their skills. After a little while, Raven approaches the characters and thanks them for helping, letting them know the villagers are all settled and they can go if they need to.

---

## Message for a Mage

At this point it’s likely that they will want to go to deliver their scrolls to Wyhan. They can easily navigate to her Apothecary, in the east sector, near to the castle. This should be during business hours:

> [!important]  
> As you walk in, a faint chime can be heard at the back of the shop. Wyhan’s Apothecary smells of liquorice and pepper and has a few meagre tables displaying good-luck charms, odd animal bones, and vials advertising various remedies. At the rear of the shop, a human woman with raven hair and a dark dress with feathered, winglike sleeves stands behind a counter heaped with open books. She looks up from her reading, says “Take a look around, don’t break anything”, and goes back to her book.  

This is Wyhan (lawful evil, human mage), a black-robed Mage of High Sorcery. She is disdainful of non-mages, and mostly interested only in herself, but is a dedicated member of the organisation.

If anyone mentions the Mages of High Sorcery, or their scrolls, she asks for their scroll and immediately opens it.

### A Test Completed

Wyhan will know whether the scroll was opened or not. She will also know the alignment of each character. Based on these, she will recommend an order to join. But don’t reveal it just yet.

|**Alignment**|**Opened Scroll**|**Didn’t Open Scroll**|
|---|---|---|
|Good|Red robes|White robes|
|Neutral|Red robes|Red robes|
|Evil|Black robes|Red robes|

She is skeptical of anyone who wishes to join the Mages and asks the following questions to each, responding with pragmatic criticism:

- Why do you think that you’re worthy of using magic?
- Do you serve your magic, or does your magic serve you?
- How will you change the world with your magic?
- If you were to lose your magic, what would you do?

She can involve them in philosophical conversation about the role of magic for as long as is necessary, then recommend an order that she thinks each is suited to.

She agrees to contact the Mages and petition for their inclusion, and will contact the characters when she hears back from the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth. Transport can be arranged to get to the Tower in order to take the Test of High Sorcery.

She will also answer a few more questions and then insist the characters buy something or get out.

---

> [!important]  
> This is where we ended. Oooluz wanted to buy some Thieves’ tools as well as look at some armour at the Hammerstrike forge. Daethia wanted the symbol of Mishakal emblazened on her shield. All have sworn fealty to Kalaman except Daethia and Xoe. I’ll use PHB for the armour prices, and I think 5 gp is good for the symbol. Thieves’ Tools are 25 gp.  

## Reporting for Duty

Once they are ready to see Marshal Vendri, they can head to the castle. If they look for Darrett at the camp, he can’t be found as he’s gone there already.

They will be directed to Vendri’s office on the second floor and told to wait outside for a few minutes, before being let in.

> [!important]  
> Marshal Vendri’s office is spare. It holds little more than a desk heaped with documents, shelves filled with rolled scrolls, and a board on which is pinned a map of the surrounding province of Nightlund. Vendri stands as you enter. ”Thank you for coming. I won’t mince words: we’re in the dark regarding the dangers I fear are fast approaching our gates, and your role will be to change that. But first, you must have questions about your duties?”  

Some important bits:

- The characters are expected to serve as a specialized squad dedicated to meeting challenges other troops can’t address.
- Each week’s military salary is paid in advance. Characters who agreed to join can pick up their first payment of 5 GP from Vendri’s clerk today.
- Characters in need of equipment can freely take any mundane weapons, light armour, or medium armour they please from the armoury on the castle’s first floor.
- Several people from Vogler have offered to lend Vendri their aid. She’s currently determining how best to use these enthusiastic conscripts.
- Vendri is still working out the details of the characters’ first assignment. In the meantime, they should familiarize themselves with the castle and their lodgings on the fourth floor.
- She doesn’t bring up Darrett or his role. If the characters ask about him, she smiles and says she’ll let him tell them himself shortly.

---

### Within the Castle

Once they leave, a guard guides the characters to the fourth floor while sharing details about the castle:

- It was built centuries ago and was long used by the Knights of Solamnia.
- Many of its halls are decorated with images of Solamnic Knights and the gods and animals they honoured.
- They see a large tapestry of a large, silver-looking dragon flying majestically over Kalaman. There’s a clear motif of justice and peace, with a triangular design featuring prominently. An easy religion check will reveal this to be Paladine, also known as Bahamut, leader of the gods of good.

The layout is as follows:

**First Floor:** The city council and governor meet and hold events on this floor. Various government offices, a small library, and the armoury are also here.

**Second Floor:** Military command and officer lodgings fill the second floor.

**Third Floor:** Castle guards lodge on the third floor. Most other soldiers reside elsewhere in the city or in the ancillary structures of the castle.

**Fourth Floor and Towers:** Much of the castle is vacant and in disrepair, including most of the fourth floor and towers. The characters have been assigned lodgings in an unused ballroom on the fourth floor.

**Basement:** The basement is used for storage, though it also holds long-sealed doors to the castle’s ruined dungeons.

---

### Castle Lodgings

Eventually they arrive at their lodgings:

> [!important]  
> This room was clearly once a small ballroom. A row of pillars, sculpted with knotworks and images of knights, supports a vaulted ceiling. Light shines into the room through tall windows facing the mountains to the south. One corner of the hall holds a collection of plain beds and empty chests and nearby stands a large wooden table.  

Each character is assigned a bed and a chest, and there are three adjoining rooms that the characters can use as they please.

As they are settling into their lodgings, Darrett will arrive and greet them warmly. He is wearing the armour that was given to him by Becklin. It fits him well. He shares the following information:

- He’s spent most of the morning demonstrating his training to Marshal Vendri and her commanders.
- They were pleased and ordered him to work with her to train a new unit of Kalaman soldiers.
- He’s also been assigned to work with the characters. He’s not their commander, but he will deliver the Marshal’s orders to them and if needed, he can advocate for the characters to Kalaman’s leaders.
- He’s been given lodgings on the third floor among the castle’s guards.
- He thanks the characters for all they’ve done for him and for Vogler. He hopes to continue to learn from and support them.

He’ll answer any questions they have but he knows little about both Kalaman and any missions to come. He’s earnest in his desire to help the characters, but also incredibly excited to be in a castle where Knights of Solamnia once walked. He’s to learn from this experience, hoping it will one day help him become a true Knight.

He finally lets them know that they have the rest of the day to themselves and he will return in the morning with their first mission.

# The First Mission

> [!important]  
> Let them play out what they’re doing in the morning. They will be allowed to eat at the mess hall, where the guards eat, as well as use the ablutions available to them. Darrett might spot them in the mess hall and say he’s off to see the Marshal to get their first assignment.  

Darrett meets the characters in their hall and relays the following orders:

- Kalaman’s leadership is disturbed to hear about the dragon-like invention the Red Dragon Army deployed in Vogler. They want to know more about it.
- Twelve miles south of Kalaman lives a gnome inventor named Tatina Rookledust.
- Vendri wants the characters to go to Rookledust’s home and see if she knows anything about this device or similar ones.
- Even if Rookledust knows nothing, Kalaman’s forces would like to meet with her in the city to recruit her as an advisor.
- Darrett won’t be joining them on this mission.

He doesn’t know much more than this but provides accurate directions to Rookledust’s home.

## Journey down Esker Brook

Ask them how they wish to travel and at what pace.

> [!important]  
> You begin your journey to the south, following the Esker Brook river for a while, before leaving it at a point well-described by Darrett.  

|d4|Encounter|
|---|---|
|1|Light rain falls for an hour, and distant lightning is visible over the Dargaard Mountains.|

He’s heard rumors about dragons near Kalaman but hasn’t seen any.|

### Rookledust’s Workshop

After another hour or so, the characters will come within sight of their destination.

> [!important]  
> On a hill stands an unusual structure that resembles both a cottage and a metal fortress. The building bristles with steaming pipes and whirring devices, and it is currently under siege.Amid clanging metal contraptions, goblins try to breach the structure, impeded by gadgets that spin, snap, and thrash in the yard. Every few moments, a gnome appears from an open clockface above the door and hucks a new clockwork calamity at the attackers while cackling and yelling insults.  

The home of the gnome Tatina Rookledust is under attack by ten goblins and—standing well back from the chaos—their hobgoblin leader. The goblinoids wear dark armour with a spiral symbol—the same colours and symbol of Takhisis commonly worn by Red Dragon Army troops.

> [!important]  
> Characters who move adjacent to a goblin expose themselves to the out-of-control clockwork devices. These devices are Small objects with AC 15, 8 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. On initiative count 0, roll on the Clockwork Chaos4 table for each character adjacent to a goblin to determine how the devices react to that character.  

|d6|Device Effect|
|---|---|
|1–2|No devices threaten the character.|
|3|A contraption that looks like a big set of teeth tries to bite the character (+3 to hit, 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit).|
|4|A bundle of thrashing cords whips around the character, who must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity** saving throw or be [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) until the end of the character’s next turn.|
|5|A device fires a dart filled with glowing green fluid at the character (+4 to hit, 1 piercing damage on a hit). On a hit, the fluid is injected with an ominous hiss—but it proves harmless.|
|6|A mechanical chicken fires tin eggs at the character (+4 to hit, 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit). On a hit, the egg bursts in an oily mess, and the character has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the character’s next turn.|

The goblins flee after half their number are defeated. The hobgoblin tries to make the goblins hold their ground but also flees if he finds himself outnumbered by the characters.

**Taken Alive**

If the characters capture and interrogate one of the goblinoids, a character who succeeds on a **DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion)** check learns the following:

- The goblinoids are members of the Red Dragon Army.
- Their commander sent them here to get a weapon.
- They don’t know much about their leaders—only that most are humans and they pay well. One is a woman whose eye glows like an ember.
- The army is to the north, near a burned village (Vogler, though they don’t know its name). The goblins are supposed to take the weapon there.

### Meeting Rookledust

Once the characters defeat the goblinoids, the gnome—Tatina Rookledust—appears through an aperture above her workshop’s door. She asks the characters who they are, what they want, and if they’re with the Dragon Army. Once she’s convinced the characters pose no threat, she comes outside and speaks with them while she cleans up the devices in her yard. She mutters to herself constantly as she does so.

### Tatina Rookledust

Tatina Rookledust (neutral good rock gnome) moved to Nightlund decades ago from the distant gnome homeland of Mount Nevermind. She uses the [acolyte](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16763-acolyte) stat block, but the effects of her Spellcasting manifest from various tools and tiny devices she always carries with her. Rookledust talks rapidly and is always formulating new ideas for her next overdesigned contraption. Though many of her creations are dangerous, she doesn’t build them with violence in mind. She’s particularly interested in devices for long-distance communication and inventions that mechanize the work of farm animals.

_**Personality Trait.**_ “The faster I talk, think, and invent, the faster I can improve my designs.”

_**Ideal.**_ “Not only can I make that, I can make it better!”

_**Bond.**_ “Through invention, we make a more interesting world.”

_**Flaw.**_ “I can make it for ya! Who are you again?”

### Talking with Rookledust

Rookledust is eager to speak with the characters once she knows they’re not affiliated with the Dragon Army. Use the following topics to guide the conversation with Rookledust:

- Rookledust is an inventor. She lives in seclusion so as not to disturb her neighbours with her experiments.
- Several weeks ago, a stranger in red-and-black armour asked to purchase her weed-clearing device, but with some modifications to make it resemble a mythical dragon. She agreed. (Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a Dragon Army agent and the device was the boilerdrak used in Vogler.)
- The stranger also hired her to design another device, which he was supposed to pick up today. Instead, the goblinoids showed up and demanded she turn over “the weapons.”
- Realizing the stranger was using her devices for malign reasons, she refused to hand over her inventions. The goblinoids then attacked.
- She’s happy to come with the characters to Kalaman and insists on giving them her newest invention (see “The Fargab”).

### The Fargab

Rookledust calls her newest invention the “fargab” (see appendix A). She was supposed to design a new weapon for the Red Dragon Army, but she got distracted and instead created this long-distance communication device. She currently has one paired set of fargabs, which she gives to the characters—and, by extension, Kalaman’s defenders.

## Back to Kalaman

After giving the characters the fargabs, Rookledust accompanies them to Kalaman. The journey back to the city is uneventful.

The city leaders welcome Rookledust as their guest and give her comfortable lodgings. In the coming days, she advises them on what little she knows about the Dragon Army and spouts ideas for inventions to aid Kalaman.

---

# Missions for Kalaman

In the days following the characters’ arrival in Kalaman, war looms ever closer. As they do these missions, reinforce the following points:

- **Dangerous Recruits.** Bandits and mercenaries have been coming to the region to join the Dragon Army. It’s said the Dragon Army pays well.
- **Draconians.** Dragon Army forces include bipedal creatures with dragon-like features. Dragon Army soldiers refer to these creatures as draconians.
- **Enemy Armor.** Dragon Army troops wear black armor with red flourishes and the symbol of Takhisis the Dragon Queen.
- **The Highmaster.** The Red Dragon Army leader is Dragon Highmaster Kansaldi Fire-Eyes. Her soldiers fear her and claim she can see through lies.
- Additionally, if the characters capture a prisoner and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion)) check, they learn one of the following pieces of information:
    - **Dread Servants.** Draconians serve the Dragon Queen fanatically and fearlessly.
    - **Flying Steeds.** The Dragon Army uses wyverns and dragonkin called dragonnels as flying steeds.
    - **Magical Threats.** Some draconians can cast spells, control the minds of others, steal the form of foes they’ve killed, or even explode when they die.

## Missions

Along with the random encounters from the table, run these missions as coming down from the leaders, through Darrett. Roll a d4 to determine if a random encounter will happen on the way to and from the main mission. Run one if a 4 is rolled. On the first encounter, only roll on the way home. Idk what the balance is like wrt health and spells etc.

> [!important]  
> Treasure: Unless stated, soldiers have 1d6 x 5 gp worth of coin, gems, and jewellery on them. An investigation check greater than 18 will reveal an item from the magic item table, but only one per encounter. Each person they loot will also have an item from the trinket table.  
  
> [!important]  
> In an effort to make this feel like they have a choice of what to do and when, I’m going to give them all three to choose from, with some consequences if they choose one over the other.  

### Ambushing the Enemy

> [!important]  
> This one can be done at any time.  

Darrett comes to the characters with the task of investigating a farmstead eighteen miles east of the city. Fleeing residents reported that the farm had been overrun by soldiers wearing red and black and bearing a star-like symbol.

When the characters arrive, they find the farm ransacked and a Dragon Army soldier training six hobgoblin mercenaries (comedy). The soldier orders the hobgoblins to attack, telling them “Here’s your final test. Dispatch these fools and earn your place in the Dragon Army!”.

The hobgoblins fight until the soldier is killed or until half of their number are wiped out.

> [!important]  
> Treasure: The soldiers’ gear includes 100 gp, 100 gp worth of gems (rubies, sapphires), and five suits of black chain mail emblazoned with the symbol of Takhisis. The soldier also carries the following message:”The Highmaster requires soldiers, not thugs. Figure out which you have, then dispatch the ones not suited to the task. This is the Dragon Queen’s will.”A very good investigation check will find the soldier wearing a Ring of Obscuring.  

---

### Draconian Blockade

Word reaches Kalaman of soldiers attacking travelers on the roads leading toward farmlands near the Estwilde border. The characters are ordered to follow the road east and see what they find.

> [!important]  
> If they choose this first, they find the blockade happening as they get there and can save 3 merchants who were travelling to Kalaman. If they wait, they find it as written.  

Twenty miles east of Kalaman, where the road crosses the Raiding Rill, the characters find two empty, toppled wagons. The wagons have large claw-marks in their sides and blood splatters across one of the sides. Three bodies lie amongst the ruined carts. Merchants, from the look of it.

A character who succeeds on a **DC 12 Wisdom (Survival)** check finds clawed footprints leading to woods to the south. If they follow the path, they come on a camp of five baaz draconians led by a bozak draconian. They fight to the death.

> [!important]  
> Treasure: The draconians have stolen 120 gp, food equivalent to 60 days of rations, and a driftglobe.If they rescue the merchants, they give the players the driftglobe, recognising them as adventurers who might use it, as well as some food (5 days each) and maybe 50 gp.  

---

### Missing Scouts

> [!important]  
> If they come here first, they find it as written. If not, they find both scouts dead and after killing the draconians, find the notes of the scouts that say the same thing, but they get no bonus for returning the scout to Kalaman alive.  

The characters are sent to track down a pair of scouts keeping tabs on Dragon Army movements north of the Vingaard River, twenty miles northwest of Kalaman and six miles east of Vogler. They can have access to a ship that will take them across the river. Darrett tells them to go to the docks and find Captain Mander.

Captain Mander is a large kender man whose first name is Jerry. “Oh no need for all that captain stuff, just call me Jerry”.

The characters are told to find the scouts’ lookout post in a stand of gray birch, trees uncommon in the area.

Once the characters arrive in the area, they find the lookout post in fifteen minutes if a character succeeds on a **DC 15 Wisdom (Survival)** check; otherwise, finding the post takes three hours.

Regardless of when the characters arrive, they find one scout tied to a tree in the centre of the camp, being harassed by two baaz draconians (see appendix B); the other scout lies dead nearby. A kapak draconian (see appendix B) hides in the trees above the camp and tries to ambush the characters after combat begins.

The scouts name is Wilf and his partner’s name was Firgil.

_**Development:**_ If the scout is freed, they report that the Dragon Army has split its forces to attack communities across Hinterlund and Nightlund. The army seems intent on isolating Kalaman from the Solamnic cities of Maelgoth and Palanthas in the west. The scout asks the party to help them return safely to Kalaman with this report. If they do so, Kalaman’s leaders are pleased and reward them with a bonus of 100 gp each.

> [!important]  
> Treasure: Default gold and an item if they roll high.

## Cudgel’s Return

After the characters bring the scouts back, have Darrett send them out having heard of priests of Takhisis trying to convert commoners to their cause in a town 15 miles south-west of Kalaman (near where Rookledust was). As they travel there, however, have them spot some commotion in the distance. A **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** **Check** spots a dwarf that looks a lot like Cudgel running from a Bozak Draconian. They each have a little less than full health but she is clearly very injured **(16 HP)**. If they don’t succeed on the check, she runs towards them but is struck down by a Lightning Discharge attack and moves at half speed. If they spot her, they can attack from afar and distract the draconian.

Whichever happens, have combat start with Cudgel **120 ft** from them, dashing to get to the characters.

With the encounter over, Cudgel will relay the information that the two of them tried to get past Vogler but by the time they made it to the crossing, some of the army had crossed over and they were spotted. They ran for a while before Becklin told Cudgel to run while she defended against the small force they’d sent to catch them. She’s not sure if Becklin died or was captured but she managed to escape, until coming across this beast only 5 miles from Kalaman. She will ask for their help to get back to Kalaman and heal up, before being reunited with her regiment, who had joined in the army as she requested they do, through Jeyev. She intends to sign up, offering to lead what is left of her force.

If asked, she will say she reckons Becklin would try to continue to Solamnia to warn the knights.

## Character Advancement

As they rest after returning Cudgel to safety, they feel the experience of the last week filling them and they level up to level 5!!!!!!1!111

Next up is the [[Wheelwatch Outpost]].

# We Begin

|**Rumours**||
|---|---|
|Greg|Some claim to hear the whispers of the old gods and believe their miracles are returning to the world.|
|Luc|A great fleet of elven ships was sighted heading west. The elves are retreating to their secret homeland.|
|Kaylie|Fools claim to have seen dragons in the East, but these are only wyverns and illusions.|
|Jordan|Travelers report sightings of cloaked lizardfolk raiders. No one knows where they’ve come from or what they want.|
|Kealan|Armies in the east are recruiting anyone who will fight for them, promising wealth and glory not seen since before the Cataclysm.|

I want to give the characters the chance to introduce themselves, where they’re coming from, and how they’re travelling to Kalaman. Once we have met them, we will begin with the preludes.

The first takes place the night before the Trial of the Barb. A group of prospective mages travelled from Kalaman to the Barb. Among them are **Greg’s character** and Zhou. They may have met each other but they have definitely seen each other in the group.

> [!important]  
> The day before the Trial of the Barb, a group of prospective Mages set out from Kalaman to take part in the Trial. Among them are Greg’s character and Daethia.Give them time to introduce their characters and what they look like, as well as why they are on their way to the Barb given that they have not studied magic before. That night they camp about halfway to the Barb, just off the road. As you drift to sleep, the two of you find yourselves experiencing a vision. It feels like a dream but you know that there’s something different about this.  

# Prelude: Broken Silence

> [!important]  
> You stand at the centre of a forest clearing. Clashing steel echoes from the thicket beyond. As you look around, you realize piles of bodies cover the ground. One of the fallen clutches something against their chest.Zhou sees it is as a small wreath of twigs with blue string woven in the middle.Greg sees it as a round clay pendant with some iridescent markings on the front.You’re not too certain what it is. Roll a DC 16 Intelligence (religion) check to try work out what it is.You both feel the urge to reach for it buy before you can, the object glows and then flashes with intense light.  
  
> [!important]  
> You awake after the blinding light to find nothing out of the ordinary. The camp is still and it is the middle of the night.  

The characters wake after having the vision and find nothing out of the ordinary. They realize the object in the vision was an amulet. The amulet bears a design they might not recognize, but is the symbol of the god the character’s player chose during character creation. The echoes of battle don’t mean anything in particular to the characters but feel like a bad omen.

**Lost and Found**

> [!important]  
> As you wake up further, you notice each other stirring in the camp while the rest sleep. You also notice that the camp has been sacked and some of your belongings are missing.A trail of food, cloth, and discarded trinkets leads off into the brush.  

If they choose to follow it, after a few hundred feet they find the rest of their belongings. Nothing is missing and it’s unclear what brought the items there.

**Mysterious Symbol and Temple**

> [!important]  
> Among your belongings, you each find an item that closely matches the amulet in your visions. You once again feel inexplicably drawn to the amulet. Daethia’s is a blue infinity symbol woven with thread into a circle of intertwined twigs.Place’s is an iridescent feather on a clay amulet.  

If they touch them, a pulse of divine energy ripples outwards and the amulet disappears. The clearing now resembles the one in their vision, but without the dead bodies.

They also see overgrown ruins that have been revealed by the blast.

> [!important]  
> A crumbling stone structure lies among the undergrowth. Its roof is pierced by the trunk of an immense tree, but its walls are mostly intact. A large, empty doorframe leads inside.  

Characters who don’t immediately go towards the ruins feel drawn to it, as if a familiar voice were calling their name. As characters approach the door, they hear faint voices inside.

> [!important]  
> The tree visible from outside breaks through the ruin’s marble floor and stretches through the collapsed ceiling. Around it, broken statues line the remaining walls, standing in crumbling alcoves.  

The statues were once larger-than-life depictions of several of Krynn’s deities, but most of them are ruined. A character who succeeds on a **DC 12** Intelligence (Religion) check can identify as many of the statues as you deem appropriate. The character instantly recognizes the statue of the god whose symbol they just found.

**Divine Manifestation**

> [!important]  
> Soon after you enter the room, a faint glow begins to emanate from two of the statues: Mishakal and Chislev. The glows coalesce around the ruined statues, creating a semblance of what they used to look like.  

Once a character approaches the statue of their deity, they hear that deity’s voice in their thoughts.

> [!important]  
> The dieties invite the characters to take their holy symbols and become their heralds in the world. They want them to carry their power and divine message into the world now, when Krynn needs it most.  

The god won’t elaborate on why they chose the character or why they’re revealing themself now. This brief conversation allows characters to learn as much as you deem necessary about their gods, and it ends with the characters gaining access to any god-granted spells and divine class features.

**Conclusion**

> [!important]  
> As soon as the characters exit and leave sight of the temple, the structure vanishes.  

The characters find no trace of any disturbance in their camp. If they were travelling with anyone else, their companions are waiting for them when they return. Any fellow travellers didn’t notice the characters leaving the camp and have no recollection of anything strange happening.

Any attempt to return to the ruined temple fails, as if it was never there.

The group continue on towards the Barb and arrive just before nightfall on the Night of the Eye, when all 3 moons of Krynn align, and magic is in the air.

> [!important]  
> As you two travel towards the Barb, you spend time reflecting on the encounter with what you can only assume was actual gods. If you search within yourself you can feel a power source that you can now draw upon.  

# Prelude: Eye in the Sky

Those who wish to join the Mages of High Sorcery must pass the “Test of High Sorcery”, an incredibly dangerous test of magical competence and creativity. On this night, the characters will take the “Trial of the Barb”, a less dangerous taste of what is to come. If they pass this test, they will learn the next steps they need to take in order to join the Mages of High Sorcery.

The characters may arrive together or apart, they may decide. As they arrive, recite the following.

> [!important]  
> Tonight is an important night. Ahead rises the Barb: a jagged, half-ruined spire of gray stone. Many who aspire to join the Mages of High Sorcery have come here to prove their magical proficiency. The Barb is usually nothing more than a ruin, its construction predating the Cataclysm. But tonight, on the Night of the Eye, when Krynn’s three moons align, the ruin is alive with magic once more. Soft light shines from the archway leading into the structure.  

_Give the other 3 time to introduce their characters and why they are taking the Trial of the Barb._

When they enter the arch, recite this:

> [!important]  
> The arch opens into a large atrium lit with flaming sconces and adorned by grand tapestries depicting Krynn’s three moons. Doors circle the room. The light of the moons cascades through broad windows high above. At the centre of the room stands a serene-looking woman with long, gray hair and red robes. She nods as you enter.  

The red-robed mage is named Rovina, and she serves as the Barb’s caretaker.

> [!important]  
> Soft spoken.”Welcome, apprentices, to the Trial of the Barb. During the Night of the Eye, this place surges with power in order to test those who wish to join the ranks of the Mages of High Sorcery. We will begin shortly, so if you have any questions, let us get through them now.”  

Characters who examine the tapestries recognize each of the three moons and their relation to the three orders of the Mages of High Sorcery.

A character who succeeds on a **DC 10** Wisdom (Perception) check realizes that while the doors in the room should lead outside, no other entrances into the Barb were visible from the exterior.

### Rules of the Trial

Rovina leads the characters to a door and shares the following information:

- To pass the night’s test, the characters must face the trial in one of the tower’s rooms, which are accessible only for the night.
- The trial requires magical talent but carries none of the dangers of the Test of High Sorcery. It provides a foundation for the real test.
- The goal is to complete the challenge presented in the room, implying different apprentices will face different challenges.
- The characters have until the Night of the Eye ends, at which point the rooms vanish, expelling everyone inside.

> [!important]  
> “In order to pass the night’s tests, you all must face the trial in one of the rooms of this tower. These rooms are only accessible for this night, and if you are still in them when day comes, you will be expelled from them and will have to wait until the next Night of the Eye, in a year and a half’s time. Of course this trial requires the use of magic but worry not, there is no danger here; we save that for the real test.As with all our trials, the challenges you face are specific to you. You may be working with others or you may be on your own. It’s not for us to know how or why this is the case. On the Night of the Eye we are simply observing what the ancient magics have in store for us.”  

### The Trial Begins

Once the characters are ready, Rovina opens a door, revealing a portal filled with swirling amber light. She directs anyone intending to face the trial to enter the portal together. Everyone passes through the portal together, including those not in the party.

### Hall of Sight

As characters pass through the door, read the following text:

> [!important]  
> The door opens into a wide rotunda with black stone floors and walls carved with elaborate runes. The interior is empty save for a single pedestal at the room’s centre. Atop the pedestal, an ornate key balances on its tip.Behind you, the door you entered through vanishes. On the opposite side of the room, an identical, closed door appears.The four of you find yourselves together, with none of the others that entered with you.  

The room is 100 feet in diameter, with a door on the wall opposite the characters and the pedestal at the centre. The door is locked and can be opened only by the key at the centre of the rotunda or by casting the knock spell on the door.

_**Invisible Maze**_. If the characters move more than 5 feet toward the pedestal, they run into an invisible wall. The wall extends to the ceiling and is part of an invisible, shifting maze that the characters must traverse to reach the key at the centre. The maze is 90 feet in diameter, leaving a 5-foot gap between it and the rotunda’s walls.

A character who casts detect magic sees the walls of the maze glow with auras of illusion and transmutation magic. Other spells that reveal invisibility, such as faerie fire or see invisibility, also reveal the walls. Characters who can see the walls can easily navigate to the maze’s centre. Characters who can’t see the walls can still complete the test, but doing so takes an hour and requires a successful **DC 14** Intelligence (Investigation) check. Characters can attempt this check again after an additional hour of effort.

_**Wall Carvings**_. The carvings on the wall around the rotunda are magical runes. A character who examines the carvings learns their meaning by succeeding on a **DC 14** Intelligence (Arcana) check or by spending an hour studying them. The runes are an arcane cipher for the knock spell. Reading the spell from the wall allows a character to cast the spell as if they were casting it from a spell scroll of knock, except the spell on the wall isn’t consumed. The characters can use this spell to open the door and complete the test.

_**Golden Key**_. Touching the key at the centre causes the walls of the maze to vanish. The key can then be used to open the locked door. The key vanishes once it is used.

### Conclusion

Upon completing the trial and passing through the door, the characters emerge into the atrium of the Barb. Rovina congratulates them on passing the challenge and deems their apprenticeship complete. They are now ready to take the next step on the path to becoming members of the Mages of High Sorcery.

> [!important]  
> “Congratulations apprentices! With that complete, I can happily say that your apprenticeship is now complete and you are ready to take the next steps towards becoming Mages of High Sorcery.Take these scrolls to a black-robed mage named Wyhan, in Kalaman. She will take you on your next steps. Do not open the scrolls under any circumstances, their contents are for Wyhan only!We will also give each of you a spellbook. We know that some of you do not require such things in order to perform your magic, but perhaps you can use it to make an account of what you learn or keep track of important information about the Mages of High Sorcery.If you have any questions, do ask them now. Otherwise congratulations once again! I wish you the best of luck on your travels.”  

Rovina hands each character an ornate scroll and a spellbook emblazoned with the symbol of the Mages of High Sorcery. She says the books are meant for the characters, either to use as spellbooks or to fill with their discoveries. The scrolls are meant for the mage who will lead the characters on the next step of their journey: a black-robed mage named Wyhan who resides in the city of Kalaman near Vogler. The characters have already received their invitation to Ispin Greenshield’s funeral, and Kalaman is conveniently nearby.

Rovina tells the characters they must take their scrolls to Wyhan. She emphasizes that they must not open the scrolls under any circumstances, as their contents are meant for Wyhan only. More details about Wyhan and the characters’ next step on the path to joining the Mages of High Sorcery can be found in chapter 4. Rovina will answer any other questions the characters have about the Mages of High Sorcery. After that, she congratulates them once more and bids them good luck on their travels.

> [!important]  
> If they choose to open the scroll, they simply see a letter that states:”Dear Mage Wyhan,This apprentice has passed the Trial of the Barb and has completed their apprenticeship.They are ready to begin their journey becoming a Mage of High Sorcery. Please assist them in this matter and answer any questions they may have.Regards,Rovina”If they cast detect magic on it, it glows with a faint light of abjuration magic.  

  

The characters are now all together, they should discuss how they’re all going to Vogler and how they all know Ispin Greenshield. After spending the night in a camp near the Barb, they set off for Vogler.

# Scales of War

**Frantic Farmer**

The prelude begins on the road to Vogler. At some point during travel, the characters encounter Rhys, a young human commoner who barely survived a recent attack on the caravan he was travelling with.

Read or paraphrase the following text to start this prelude:

> [!important]  
> As you travel down the road, you hear quivering scream from around the next corner. “Please, help!” a young man shouts as he rushes around a bend ahead and races toward you.  

This young man is Rhys. He’s terrified and barely coherent in his frantic pleas for help. If a character spends a minute trying to calm Rhys down, he finally realizes he’s not being chased by anything. Once this happens, Rhys reveals the following information:

- Rhys works at a nearby farm and was hired by a group of soldiers to travel with them and care for their horses.
- Rhys doesn’t know much about the soldiers. He heard them talk about enemy troops supposedly afoot in the region.
- Just moments ago, the soldiers Rhys was with were attacked by black-cloaked figures.
- Rhys didn’t get a good look at the cloaked attackers. He hid in the brush and escaped while the soldiers fought them off.

If the characters are visibly armed, Rhys urges them to help the soldiers, fearing his employers might fall against their attackers. He can lead the characters to where the caravan was attacked, about a half mile down the road.

Rhys doesn’t know this, but the soldiers who hired him weren’t merely solders—they were Knights of Solamnia who were deployed to investigate reports of recent attacks by strange creatures in the region.

**Fallen Caravan**

Rhys leads the characters down the road. Once they approach the place where Rhys and the soldiers were ambushed, Rhys refuses to go any farther. He tells the characters the soldiers should be just ahead. The ambush site is a few hundred feet ahead. Read the following text when the characters arrive:

> [!important]  
> Remember to really amp up the weirdness of the Draconians. Bring in some marks of horror.  
  
> [!important]  
> A wrecked wagon lies toppled, surrounded by armoured corpses. Strange figures pick through the remains. From beneath the figures’ dark cloaks jut scaly wings and sharp, reptilian features. You can hear grunts and wheezes as they stamp around, as well as guttural noises you might expect to hear from ancient, long-forgotten beasts.  

The mysterious raiders are a kapak draconian and four baaz draconians (see appendix B for both stat blocks). They wear armour emblazoned with the symbol of Takhisis, which any character can recognize by succeeding on a **DC 12** Intelligence (Religion) check.

  

If the characters want to remain hidden, have them roll Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the kapak draconian’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score of **13**. If the draconians don’t notice the characters, they pick the wagon clean of valuables and leave shortly after.

If the draconians notice the characters, the kapak draconian orders two of the baaz draconians to attack, then slips away with the other two into the surrounding forest. The baaz draconians are battered from the fight with the knights and have half their normal hit points. The retreating draconians won’t fight the characters under any circumstances; they have orders to immediately rejoin the Dragon Army elsewhere and report on the knights’ fate.

> [!important]  
> Remember to reduce the Baaz draconians to half HP, and use the following things:- Death Throes. When the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points, its body turns to stone and releases a petrifying gas. Each creature within 5 feet of the draconian must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be restrained as it begins to turn to stone. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends; otherwise the creature is petrified for 1 minute. After 1 minute, the body of the draconian crumbles to dust.  

**Murdered Knights**. By the time the characters arrive, the three soldiers who hired Rhys have been killed. They are beyond the aid of a revivify spell. A character who examines the dead soldiers’ armour and succeeds on a **DC 12** Intelligence (History) check recognizes them as Knights of Solamnia.

If the characters search the remains, they find correspondence that states the knights were investigating reports of nearby farmsteads being raided by strange creatures that match the draconians’ descriptions.

**Treasure**. The three soldiers each wear plate armour with filigree and horned helmets distinctive to Knights of Solamnia, but each suit bears vicious claw marks that make it unusable. Among the wreckage are also three longswords, eight days of food and water for one person, and 40 gp.

**Conclusion**

Shortly after the draconians are defeated, Rhys rejoins the characters and asks them what those monsters were. He has no idea, and the characters likely don’t either. This is one of the first times draconians have made their way into Solamnia, but it won’t be the last.

If battle turns against the characters, another group of travelers can be heard approaching on the road. Not wanting to risk a larger fight, the wounded draconians retreat, leaving the characters to be saved by these travelers, who are also headed to Vogler.

# Moving on

After that is settled, the characters continue on their way to Vogler. They spend the night a few miles from the ferry crossing and cross over in the morning.

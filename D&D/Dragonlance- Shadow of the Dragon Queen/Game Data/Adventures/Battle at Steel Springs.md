The trip from Wheelwatch back to Kalaman is uneventful. On their return to Castle Kalaman, the character with the highest passive Wisdom (**Perception**) score notices the castle is unusually quiet. When the characters report to Marshal Vendri’s office, an aide informs them the marshal is away from Kalaman and shares the following facts:

- After the characters left Kalaman, the city council got word that a contingent of Dragon Army troops had broken away from the larger force.
- Tired of measured steps, members of Kalaman’s leadership—spurred by Lord Bakaris—demanded Kalaman’s military ride out to seize a victory.
- With Marshal Vendri away leading troops further west, Governor Miat approved the strike.
- Lord Bakaris and his son are leading the attack. Darrett is serving under them.
- They plan to ambush the Red Dragon Army near a crossing of the Inkwater called Steel Springs, thirty miles west of Kalaman.

The aide knows nothing more, but before the characters leave, the aide discreetly slips them a sealed note signed by Darrett that reads as follows:

> [!note] Note from Darrett
> Come at once. Bakaris is leading us to ruin at Steel Springs. He's the commander of this mission, and I can't disobey. I'll do what I can, but I need your help.

If the characters seek out Governor Miat, he’s busy conducting other business with the city’s guild leaders and won’t be available for hours. Even if the characters find him, he isn’t a military leader, doesn’t understand the characters’ concern, and can do little now the troops have been sent.

# Arriving in Vogler

The day the characters arrive is the day of Ispin’s funeral. They are taking the ferry across the Vingaard river, arriving at the docks.

> [!important]  
> The fishing village of Vogler clings to a spit of land reaching into the Vingaard River. Wooded cliffs overlook the community, and the only path from the north descends past the ivy-covered remnants of a crumbling stone keep. The village’s modest wooden buildings cluster around a quaint central circle and along the riverbank.Jutting into the river—out of place and seemingly out of time—stands an incomplete stone bridge of incredible artisanship. The structure clearly dates to before the Cataclysm, eclipsing its modern peers in size and sturdiness. The bridge crosses less than half the river’s width before giving way to a series of ropes and tethered rafts serving as ferries.On the river itself, dozens of small boats drift along the slow, murky waters as the fishers of Vogler ply their trade.  

- Describe the Brass Crab, a single story Inn that leads out onto the river with a small dock in front of it. It vaguely resembles a crab, with brass glinting in the sunshine and its claws extending into the water.
- As they arrive, they are warmly welcomed into the town by the fishers and dockworkers, before finding themselves standing amongst the market.
- Make sure to play up its quaint charms

# Final Farewell

Once the characters have reconnected with one another and explored Vogler to their liking, it’s time to assemble at the Brass Crab for the funeral of Ispin Greenshield. [[Becklin Uth Viharin]], who sent the characters their funeral invitations, catches up to the characters prior to the funeral.

> [!important]  
> As you enter the Brass Crab, you feel the solemn atmosphere wash over you. People talk slowly and in hushed voices. Standing still in small groups. Near the entrance you spot Becklin; she’s hard to miss with her gleaming full-plate armour on and horned helmet in hand. She immediately approaches you and recognises you from Ispin’s descriptions of you. ”Hello friends! Welcome to Vogler, I’m glad you’re here but only wish it could’ve been under better circumstances. Ispin spoke highly of all of you, I’m sure it came as a shock to receive my letter. “”Please have a drink. Ispin wouldn’t have wanted us all to be moping around like this so let’s try and lift the mood in here. In a little while we’ll send him off in the traditional manner, then we will of course share our stories of Ispin, as he would have wanted.”  

She leads the characters towards the bar and heads off to chat with another villager, trying to raise spirits in the name of Ispin.

## Sending off a friend

Soon after this, everyone begins to congregate on the docks extending from the rear of the Brass Crab. Becklin encourages the characters to stay near to the dock, then takes her place next to a simple boat resting on top of the dock.

> [!important]  
> Locals in small fishing boats assemble in the water nearby. Those who were closest to Ispin Greenshield gather on the dock overlooking the Vingaard River. There, Ispin’s body rests in a small boat, his body wrapped in a shroud. A small band of musicians, most of which have only ever played at funerals, play a soft, lamenting song as the knight Becklin Uth Viharin steps forward in her ornate Solamnic armour. Beside her is a dwarven woman, wearing armour that looks fairly basic when compared to Becklin’s full-plate, but is in pristine condition, clearly looked after well by its owner. Becklin smiles gently at those assembled, and her voice carries clearly across the water.  
  
> [!important]  
> “You all knew Ispin as a friend, and there were none like him. Before he died, he told me this: ‘There should be tales, not tears, for an old scoundrel like me. Make sure everyone knows my stories when I head off on the greatest adventure of them all.’”Becklin nods, and villagers carry the boat containing Ispin’s body to the dock’s edge, where she and the dwarven woman lower it into the water. “So, let us do just that,” Becklin continues as the tiny vessel drifts out onto the Vingaard River. “On the eve of the Kingfisher Festival, we celebrate you, Ispin. Good travels, friend. Until we meet again.”  

After a moment of silence watching the boat drift off into the distance and out of sight, Becklin says

> [!important]  
> “Come now, all of you, and let’s celebrate Ispin in the only way that feels appropriate: by telling stories of him that no-one in a million years would ever believe!”  

---

## Tales Remembered

The funeral reception is a simple but crowded affair. Yalme, the Brass Crab’s proprietor, keeps bread, cheese, and local ale coming for the dozens of attendees. Practically everyone in the village makes an appearance at the reception, and the characters can find anyone they’ve already met in the village with whom they might want to talk.

It’s not long before Becklin calls for everyone’s attention.

> [!important]  
> “Alright everyone, I think it’s time we do what we’ve all been waiting for. I spent a while trying to pick which story of Ispin’s would be best to tell here and I simply couldn’t decide. From his tales chasing cheeky Kender all around Ansalon simply for some piece of jewellery he used to court a woman who ended up rejecting him, to his time in Silvanesti working for the Speaker of the Stars, Lorac Caladon, I settled on possibly my favourite:I always loved his retelling of the time he was living amongst the gnomes on Sancrist Island. A number of locals chuckle in recognition. As he told it, the gnomes are an inventive bunch so there was no shortage of explosions and catapultings around Mount Nevermind. One day, however, the characteristic sound of a gnomeflinger was accompanied by the distressed shriek of a weasel. He looked up to see the tiniest speck shooting across the sky to the south. A few hours later he was called to meet with the Senior Artillerist of Mount Nevermind, who asked him to discreetly but quickly track down her pet weasel. He said it took him days of trekking up and down mountains, following tales of the “screaming projectile” until he found it leagues away, having been adopted by a family of direwolves. He never did say what he did to get the weasel away from the wolves but he somehow got it back to Mount Nevermind and was paid handsomely for his troubles.”The crowd all laugh and applaud.”Now please, if you have any tales to share, truthful or not, please share them now. Perhaps our newcomers would like to share some that we’ve not heard before?”  

Becklin gives the floor to the characters. Other locals also add their stories to the mix.

---

## Heckler

- Good looks
- Fine clothes
- Disinterested

During the storytelling, after one or two characters or others have told tales, a finely dressed local named [[Bakaris “the Younger” Uth Estide]] lets out an exaggerated yawn. If left to continue, he eventually blurts out, “We’ve heard this a thousand times!” or “You’re telling it worse than he did!” Bakaris cares nothing for Ispin’s death or the locals’ mourning—he’s only here for the free ale, which he claims is the worst he’s ever tasted. The other mourners grumble, but nobody directly confronts the heckler.

**Establishing Bakaris**. Use this interaction to establish Bakaris the Younger as a cowardly cad. He and his father are local annoyances, and they’ll further antagonize the characters later in the adventure. This encounter with Bakaris shouldn’t come to violence, but it should give the characters an accurately negative impression of him.

**Confronting the Heckler**. A character who confronts Bakaris the Younger can convince him to stay quiet by roleplaying or succeeding on a **DC 12** Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. After any confrontation, Bakaris the Younger scoffs and complains no one in Vogler can take a joke, then leaves of his own volition.

---

## Meeting Cudgel

After the stories have been told, people go back to mingling and chatting about Ispin. [[Ridomir Cudgel Ironsmile]] jovially introduces herself to the characters as an old friend of Ispin Greenshield and the leader of the Ironclad Regiment—mercenaries currently camped outside Vogler. Cudgel asks the characters how they knew Ispin and where they traveled from.

She talks openly about herself and her plans to participate in tomorrow’s reenactment of the Battle of High Hill. Cudgel has no agenda other than to chitchat with out-of-town guests, as they likely have more in common with her than the local fishers. Early in the evening, Cudgel excuses herself to check on her company at the mercenary camp (detailed in the “Vogler Gazetteer” section).

---

## Mysterious Mourner

A particularly somber guest—a blue-skinned Silvanesti elf named Leedara—keeps to the fringes of the reception. No one in town knows anything about her except her name, that she arrived a day before the characters, and that she claims to be a performer who knew Ispin. Characters who approach Leedara find her politely aloof and evasive about how she knew Ispin—yet she expresses sympathy for the characters, claiming she’s lost many loved ones in her long life. A character can convince Leedara to perform by succeeding on a **DC 16** Charisma (Persuasion) check, in which case she sings a heartbreakingly beautiful Silvanesti song in Elvish. Soon after, Leedara leaves the reception, retiring to her room in the inn.

Leedara has a role to play later in the adventure (see chapters 4 and chapter 7). Use this scene to introduce this mysterious character, but don’t reveal anything of her agenda (detailed below).

---

## After the Funeral

After each character who wants to has shared a story or mingled with the locals, the reception winds down. Before the characters retire for the evening, Becklin approaches, thanks them for coming, and says she has something Ispin left for them. She won’t say what it is but asks the characters to call on her at Thornwall Keep in the morning.

---

> [!important]  
> We left off at the end of the funeral with Becklin’s invite to meet her at Thornwall keep for a last gift from Ispin the following morning  

---

# A Parting Gift

The next morning, the characters can take Becklin up on her invitation any time before midday, as that’s when the Kingfisher festival festivities begin. They’re welcome to wander about town and interact with NPCs before heading up there.

> [!important]  
> The town is abuzz with festive energy this morning as locals set up stalls and hang decorations.  

## Meeting Darrett

Once they characters decide to head towards the keep

> [!important]  
> Ahead, the road to Thornwall Keep climbs a low hill toward an ancient edifice, ghostly in the morning mist.  

They will pass a small shop and as they do, they hear coming from inside:

> [!important]  
> “Good morning, Becklin’s friends,” comes a cheerful voice. “I’m glad I caught you.” From a shop doorway steps a young man, no more than twenty years old. He has a sword at his hip and a cloth sack in his arm. “I’m Darrett, Becklin’s student. I hope you haven’t had breakfast already.”  

Darrett is off to the Fishbowl to collect some pies for Becklin, himself, and the characters if they’ll have them. He invites them to come along on his errand and then he’ll show them the way to the keep.

If the characters would rather just go, he’ll not press it and go about his business.

Darrett should be portrayed as a wide-eyed, enthusiastic, **_good_**, character. Hit these notes:

- Eager to learn anything and everything from travellers
- Eager to please, and a little starstruck
- Trustworthy
- Parents abandoned him in Vogler years ago
- Becklin has been incredibly kind to him, teaching him the ways of the Knights of Solamnia
- The people of Vogler frown on the Knighthood but he still aspires to their goals
- Sometimes catches himself speaking in “non-knightly” ways, for which he apologises profusely

He shares the following details:

- The annual festival celebrates the victory of a Knight of Solamnia, Lord Decater Vogler, over the forces of the Empire of Istar. This battle occurred hundreds of years ago, long before the Cataclysm, and sparked the village’s founding.
- Today’s festivities include music, food, and games associated with the town’s founding.
- Mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment—Cudgel Ironsmile’s band—are training Vogler’s small militia. They’re also participating in a reenactment of the Battle of High Hill this afternoon.

Once he stops at the Fishbowl and purchases hand pies, he leads them to the keep.

## Thornwall Keep

> [!important]  
> Veins of bronze-colored ivy cling to Thornwall Keep’s ancient three-story stone tower, the tallest structure in Vogler. From its crenelated roof rises an elaborate device resembling a catapult. Crumbling ruins of walls and other fallen structures surround the keep, and amid them lie several shallow square pits and covered excavation sites. As you arrive, Becklin meets you at the door in a simple shirt and breeches, welcoming you inside to her first-floor library.  

If Darrett is with them, he hands out the pies and digs into his right away, listening intently to whatever the characters have to say.

Becklin strikes up conversation while she sits down on one of the many chairs in the library, offering a seat to the characters.

- “So how are you finding Vogler?”
- “You’re really here a the best time of year, the Kingfisher festival is truly the most wonderful time. I hope you’ll take part in the fishing games?”
- “Did you know Vogler was founded after the Battle of High Hill, by Lord Decater Vogler, a Knight of Solamnia like myself? These ruins hold some incredibly interesting secrets. Of course the gnomeflinger on top is a recent addition, courtesy of our tinker gnome: Than”

Once the conversation dies down and they are finished eating, Becklin excuses herself to find the gift that Ispin left for the characters.

> [!important]  
> Becklin reenters the room carrying a shallow wooden box, approximately three feet to a side. She sets it down gently on a table. “Ispin left this for all of you,” she explains. “But it comes with a condition. Since he won’t be attending the Kingfisher Festival this year, he wanted you all to participate for him. Specifically, he hoped you’d take his place during the reenactment of the Battle of High Hill. Every year, he looked forward to participating—and dying—in an even more ludicrous way than the year before. Perhaps you spellcasters can add a new flair that he never could.”Becklin smiles at the memory as she opens the box, revealing a round, mossy green shield, carved with a scarred broadleaf tree.You all recall hearing Ispin’s story of being given the shield by a unicorn in the far-off forest of Darken Wood. “Ispin always claimed there was magic to the shield but who knows with him.”  

The shield is a standard +1 shield.

Becklin is happy to chat further but soon will excuse herself to prepare for the festival. Darrett eagerly suggests going along with the characters.

---

# The Kingfisher Festival

When the characters return to town after visiting Thornwall Keep, the Kingfisher Festival is in full swing. Either Darrett leads them to the centre of town, or they can follow the people there. They find Mayor Raven Uth Vogler about to address the crowd.

> [!important]  
> Colorful banners and paper decorations shaped like kingfishers decorate the village circle. Temporary stalls sell food and colourful crafts, and in the centre of the circle, an ancient tree provides shade for happy picnickers. From a temporary stage, a band of local musicians brings a spirited song to a close as Mayor Raven Uth Vogler takes the stage.“Welcome, friends!” the mayor begins, raising her arms high. “Welcome to the Kingfisher Festival!”Cheers and applause fill the circle. The mayor smiles widely. “Today is a day of not only revelry but also reflection. We are all here thanks to the courage of heroes who came before us. Let us honour our founders, our family, and all those who can’t be here to celebrate today. Enjoy your festival, Vogler, with good spirits, good times, and good friends! And look to the kingfishers for good luck!”An energetic round of cheers follows the mayor’s words. With that, the Kingfisher Festival is officially underway.  

The townsfolk share food and drink in the crowd while a rotating series of enthusiastic musicians take the stage to entertain them all.

The stalls around the circle sell a variety of fish-filled pastries, sweet drinks, and kingfisher-shaped crafts for 3CP each.

---

## Festivities

Darrett and others encourage the characters to take part in the festivities, including the annual competition to mark the start of the season: The fish catch!

### Fish Catch

Traffic flows steadily from the village circle to the wharf. Here, the fish catch pits amateur fishers against the community’s best anglers, all competing to catch the largest fish. Characters who go to the wharf are invited to participate in this popular event and, if they accept, are lent fishing poles and bait. At the end of each 30-minute contest, participants are given charming but valueless trophies; bragging rights are the real prize at stake.

Should characters choose to participate, they find one of Vogler’s best fishers, Mayor Raven, is in their group, along with a dozen other locals. Read the following description when the characters have their fishing gear prepared and are ready to start:

> [!important]  
> A fishing pole resting on her shoulder, Raven takes her place as one of the competitors and beckons other participants to line up with her along the docks. “It’s time to find out who among us kingfisher fisherfolk is the fisher king!” the mayor says as she casts her line into the Vingaard River. The competitors receive her pun with good-spirited groans and laughter, then cast their lines as well.  

**Running the Contest**. The contest plays out in three 10-minute rounds. After a character spends 10 minutes fishing, roll on the Fish to Catch table to determine whether a fish tugs on their line and, if so, the DC of the Wisdom (Survival) check required to catch it. The character then makes a **Wisdom (Survival)** check, catching the fish if they succeed and losing it if they fail. A character has advantage on this check if they brought their own fishing gear to the contest rather than borrowing gear. If a character fails this check by 10 or more, they are pulled into the water and are out of the contest.

> [!important]  
> Bad Sport. Lord Bakaris drinks heavily during the festival and spends much of his time on the wharf, watching the fish catch and grumbling about how boring it is. He stands near the most competent-looking character participating in the contest and mockingly asks why they enjoy such a ridiculous pastime. For as long as Lord Bakaris is present, the character he’s haranguing has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made during the fish catch. Characters can make Lord Bakaris go away by roleplaying or succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.  

|**d20**|**Catch DC**|**Fish**|
|---|---|---|
|1–3|—|No fish|
|4–7|8|Tiny river eel (1 ft. long)|
|8–11|10|Tiny cuirassed carp (1 ft. long)|
|12–15|11|Mature river eel (1½ ft. long)|
|16–18|12|Mature cuirassed carp (3 ft. long)|
|19|15|Greater cuirassed carp (5 ft. long)|
|20|18|Benebog the Line Breaker (8 ft. long)|

**Benebog the Line Breaker**. This enormous cuirassed carp is a Vogler legend. Even sighting Benebog is considered good luck, and catching it makes a fisher an instant town legend. Benebog can be caught only once. If a character rolls a 20 on the Fish to Catch table after Benebog has been caught, a greater cuirassed carp tugs on their line instead.

**Contest Winner.** The winner is determined by totalling the length of all fish each participant caught. Mayor Raven’s catch totals 7 feet, followed by a villager whose catch totals 5 feet. The participant with the highest total is the winner. Participants then receive prizes.

**Contest Prizes.** All contest participants receive tiny wooden carvings of kingfishers, while the winner receives their choice of a blue knit cap or a fishing fly made from blue feathers. These prizes are charmingly made but have no significant value. Should a character catch Benebog, the mayor gives the character an exceptionally crafted fishing pole carved with kingfishers, worth 50 GP. Additionally, for the rest of the day, the villagers laud the character with congratulations and free drinks.

**Repeat Contests**. Characters can participate in the fish catch as many times as they like. On future rounds, the best villager catches fish totalling 1d4 + 3 feet. Mayor Raven doesn’t participate again.

After the fishing competition is done, the players can interact with whoever they like in the town, but eventually it’ll be time for the Battle of High Hill

---

# Betrayal at High Hill

Mayor Raven begins to rally the town’s militia in the village circle. The re-enactment will happen at High Hill, about 30 minutes north of town. Afterwards, there will be a feast at the Brass Crab.

Once all are assembled, the militia lead a haphazard parade from the town to High Hill, passing through the River Gate in the north of town. The gate is carved with 2 leaping fish on its frame, and over the years many prayers for bountiful fishing have been carved into it. The bottom of the gate is embedded in the earth such that the gates could not be closed without a great deal of work.

A wagon filled with drinks and snacks follows behind, for the audience.

Becklin finds the characters in the parade and asks if they are going to honour Ispin’s wishes to take part. The following are important points to get across to the characters.

- This mock battle reenacts the Knights of Solamnia’s ancient victory over enemy forces from the eastern nation of Istar. The battle was led by Lord Vogler, a noble knight and the village’s founder.
- This year, Mayor Raven arranged for a friend of the town, the mercenary leader Cudgel Ironsmile, to participate. Cudgel’s Ironclad Regiment is playing the part of the invading Istarian forces. The mayor claims it’s a happy coincidence Cudgel’s band was in the area during the event.
- Mayor Raven has given the village’s militia a lot of attention recently. Some villagers think she hired Cudgel to visit Vogler and help with this event—possibly because of vague rumors of war in the east. With trained mercenaries on the opposing side, this year’s reenactment could be more of a challenge for the militia than in past years.

Eventually the characters find themselves at High Hill

> [!important]  
> Passing through woods and fields, Vogler’s parade of militia members and reenactment spectators finally reaches High Hill. The grassy slope is spotted with trees and crumbled stone fencing. Near the base, several dozen soldiers in matching armour stand in even formation. The contrast is striking between these mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment and Vogler’s militia—with their mismatched armour and crooked helmets—but it does nothing to dampen the spirits of those assembled for the Kingfisher Festival’s climactic reenactment.  

Mayor Raven meets up with Cudgel in order to discuss final preparations for the event while participants and spectators break into two groups. Participants pick up their wooden weapons and ready themselves for the show.

If anyone flatly refuses to join in, Mayor Raven offers them 5 GP to be a judge, in the middle of the battle making sure nobody uses real weapons and helping those who may get hurt by accident.

Mayor Raven calls out to the participants, telling them that the mercenaries will charge up the west side of the hill while the militia and others will charge down. They will clash midway down and engage in a mock fight, with the mercenaries eventually retreating. The characters are given wooden spears with padded tips to prevent them from dealing damage. Raven reminds everyone to not use force and to put on a good show.

Mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment use the [guard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard) stat block. Members of the Vogler militia also use the guard stat block, but their spears are padded and deal no damage.

---

## Battle Begins

Once they’re ready, Darrett leads the characters into line and takes his place. He looks very proud to be part of this

> [!important]  
> After much laughter and jostling, the mayor, Cudgel, and other spectators walk to a nearby vantage to watch. As they do, the militia takes up its position atop High Hill—the same hill Solamnic troops held centuries ago. They face the mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment at the base of the hill, arrayed as the forces of Istar once were. Although the event is only a reenactment, a tingle of excitement fills the field. Somewhere on the line, a reenactor hoots and yells, “Let’s send those Istarian rats running!”A moment later, a trumpet blast signals the start of the battle. “For Istar!” yells the mercenaries’ leader, a tall half-ogre among several mounted soldiers. The mock Istarian troops assault the hill. Around you, the Vogler militia charges to meet them.  

As the two groups charge together, each character must roll a **Wisdom (Perception)** check. The character who rolls highest notices the sun glinting off the tips of the spears on the other side of the battle, as well as off the steel axe in the hand of their half-ogre leader Gragonis. Once they realise what’s going on, it’s too late to stop anyone and the forces clash. A real battle begins.

> [!important]  
> The unexpected sound of metal clashing on armour rings across the field, silencing laughter and melodramatic boasts. A ribbon of red splashes over the grassy hill, followed by shocked screams. Any pretence of a reenactment shatters—High Hill is the site of a true battle once more. Within moments, all around you, armed mercenaries attack unprepared villagers fighting for their lives.  

The characters find themselves in the middle of a battlefield, starting adjacent to the log at the north of the map. They have little opportunity to aid the villagers as three hostile mercenaries, each mounted on warhorses, appear on the road at the southwest edge of the battlefield. They see Darrett and others battling off to the side.

### The Fray

The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents dozens of clashing combatants. This area and the battlefield beyond the map are difficult terrain. A creature that enters the Fray for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a **DC 16** Dexterity saving throw or take **(2d6) slashing damage** from opportunistic foes. The Fray can’t be damaged and remains until the battle ends.

### Wall and Cart

Both the stone walls and the supply cart are **difficult terrain.** They grant **half cover** to creatures behind them.

### Battlefield Events

During this encounter, roll on the High Hill Battlefield Events table each round at initiative count 0. Also consider rolling on the table if a character enters the Fray or otherwise tries to leave the battlefield.

|**d4**|**Events**|
|---|---|
|**1**|A volley of arrows falls on a random player character’s position. That character and each creature within 10 feet of them must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage.|
|**2**|Two terrified, riderless warhorses bolt from the Fray. One random player character must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). The horses then dash off the battlefield.|
|**3**|An injured member of Vogler’s militia (a [guard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard) with 1 hit point) crawls onto the battlefield and begs for help, appearing in an unoccupied space adjacent to the Fray nearest a random  <br>character.|
|**4**|A hostile mercenary [guard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard) with 6 hit points appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the Fray nearest a random mercenary on the battlefield. The guard takes their turn on initiative count 10.|

---

> [!important]  
> We have defeated the first band of mercenaries and Gragonis has arrived. Not much damage has been dealt to the characters :))))  

## Gragonis Arrives

As the characters prevail against the mounted guards, or whenever it feels appropriate, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!important]  
> A hulking figure swinging a formidable battleaxe leads a band of mercenaries through the chaos. He cuts through the few remaining members of Vogler’s militia as he draws closer. You recognise him as the half-ogre Gragonis, the one who lead the mercenaries against the villagers. 4 mercenaries follow him and face you.  

Gragonis and his men emerge from the west edge of the battlefield.

---

## Aftermath

Once Gragonis is defeated, the other mercenaries scatter and retreat. The retreat is further motivated by Cudgel, who is absolutely **horrified and screaming commands at her troops**, but they just run. She is accompanied by the Mayor, Becklin, and several burly spectators. They have clearly seen some fighting already (the mercenaries attempted to kill Cudgel).

Darrett soon joins the characters, as well as any notable NPCs that took part.

If all the characters were defeated, they are dragged to safety by Darrett and others nearby and helped to 1 HP as the others arrive.

### Response

Mayor Raven thanks the characters for defending her people, fearing things would have gone far worse if they hadn’t. **She promises to reward the characters**, but at the moment, she’s focused on treating the wounded and getting everyone back to Vogler safely.

---

### Cudgel Betrayed

As the characters and Mayor Raven speak, Cudgel Ironsmile seeks answers. While the battle was taking place, **one of her own mercenaries appeared and attacked her, only to be killed by Becklin**. The typically unflappable mercenary commander is livid.

It doesn’t take her long to find one of her mercenaries who was wounded but survived the battle—possibly Gragonis, if the characters spared him. She angrily shakes and yells at the wounded mercenary. The characters can roll a **DC 14** Wisdom (Insight) check. **Success will tell them that, if nobody interferes Cudgel will probably kill this mercenary.**

If the characters don’t act first, Mayor Raven calms Cudgel and has the traitor bound for the walk back to Vogler where they can be interrogated (see the “Mercenary Interrogation” section).

---

### Healing the Wounded

Most of Vogler’s militia died during the battle, but if the characters search for wounded, they find a few souls in need of aid. A character who succeeds on a **DC 12** Wisdom (Medicine) check can bring a villager back from the brink of death. A character can also use healing magic to save a wounded villager by restoring 1 or more hit points. Any healed villager thanks their saviour, giving the character a piece of jewelery or lucky charm worth 20 GP.

> [!important]  
> If a character openly uses the power of a god to save a villager, locals who see this are awed and consider it nothing less than a miracle. A villager saved in this way is particularly thankful and seeks to learn more about the character’s deity.  

---

### Back to Vogler

After the wounded are tended to, Mayor Raven and Becklin urge the villagers to return to Vogler so they can organize a proper response. Raven and Becklin ask the characters to escort the villagers home safely in case of further threats, but the sombre return trip to Vogler proves uneventful. **Roll some dice as you describe the way home, just for fun :D**

---

> [!important]

# Back in Vogler

After returning to Vogler, Mayor Raven, Cudgel, and Becklin ask the characters to join them at the Brass Crab as Darrett and other villagers tend to the wounded. **The Kingfisher Festival’s levity is abandoned** as worried locals seek refuge or mill about the village circle, uncertain how to help.

The Brass Crab’s owner, Yalme, had prepared the tavern’s common room for a night of celebration, but those plans are quickly abandoned when the characters arrive with the village leaders. Mayor Raven leads the conversation, prioritizing the following points:

- She has instructed the villagers to tend to the wounded, and collect any bodies from High Hill
- She wants to understand why the Ironclad regiment attacked. She’s certain that Cudgel was betrayed and that perhaps the captive mercenary will have answers.
- We need to find out if other mercenaries are nearby/if the village is still in danger
- If one of the characters used healing magic, or even better the magic of the gods, she insists they help with tending the wounded

Cudgel has one concern: She wants to return to her camp once the mercenary has been interrogated. She will not allow anyone to deter her, or even go with her; she won’t endanger anyone else unnecessarily.

The players can pose their own plans, but if nothing better comes up, Raven encourages them to stay in the village until they learn more, and to take part in the interrogation, if for nothing other than to stop Cudgel murdering the mercenary.

---

## Mercenary Interrogation

> [!important]  
> A room in the Brass Crab is turned into an interrogation room. The captive mercenary is brought in with their chest and arms bound by a fishing net.  

If the players didn’t spare the life of Gragonis, the mercenary is simply a low-ranking guard called **Svilnt Sunderlit.** Raven doesn’t oppose the use of coercive magic, but **she refuses to let anyone harm the captive.**

Cudgel begins the interrogation but quickly becomes enraged and excuses herself to stop herself from hurting the mercenary. She watches from a distance, interjecting at particularly bad news.

The mercenary initially refuses to give up any information other than his name. By coercing the captive through roleplaying and then (maybe) by succeeding on a **DC 12** Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, the characters learn the following information:

- Gragonis planned to kill Cudgel and take control of the Ironclad Regiment.
- Several days ago, Gragonis headed into the woods west of the mercenary camp, then returned with a considerable amount of gold.
- Afterward, Gragonis hired his most loyal mercenaries to attack the Vogler militia during the reenactment. He planned to then raid Vogler.
- The mercenary doesn’t know who gave Gragonis the gold he used to pay off the mercenaries. He was selective with who he bribed. Cudgel put him in charge of choosing the squad to do the reenactment, and he chose those he knew would betray her for money.
- A few mercenaries remained at their camp, including Jeyev, Cudgel’s other lieutenant. The mercenary thinks the others at the camp are loyal to Cudgel—the ones Gragonis paid accompanied him to the reenactment. Those who remained knew nothing of the betrayal.

If Gragonis is the mercenary being interrogated, he claims not to know who his benefactor was, other than they were hooded and wore black and red armour.

---

## A Tense Evening

When the characters are done questioning the mercenary, the captive is placed under guard in a nearby shed. Cudgel heads out soon after, intent on verifying the mercenary’s story at her camp. **She promises to return by the following dawn.**

Mayor Raven is eager to learn more about Gragonis’s meeting in the woods west of town, despite not wanting anyone else to leave the village. **She labours over not wanting to send people out, thinking perhaps it would be best if some hunters crept out in the morning**. If the player’s offer to go instead, she responds with gratitude and offers Darrett as their guide.

---

# Sighting the Enemy

Either that night or the following morning, depending on what the characters decide to do, they (or the hunters) head out to investigate the nearby woods.

> [!important]  
> If villagers conduct this reconnaissance, they report back by midmorning with dire information, having learned everything the characters would in the following expedition.  
  
> [!important]  
> About an hour west of the village, guided by Darrett, the players come across a small wooded area. It looks like a fairly popular spot for hunting.  

A character who spends an hour searching the woods, or succeeds on a **DC 14** Wisdom (Survival) check, **finds strange tracks**. Some of these tracks are boot prints, while others are clawed reptilian feet the characters can’t identify.

> [!important]  
> Ask who it was that tracked the lizard people last time, before they got to Vogler. They recognise them as the same tracks.  

The tracks wind north through the woods. Following the tracks takes more than an hour, leading the characters from the woods into rugged hills. In a valley, they see the following:

> [!important]  
> The woods give way to a ledge overlooking a shallow valley. In the distance, dozens of low fires illuminate hundreds of red tents. Among them move patrols of shadowy, humanlike figures, covered in cloaks like those the characters saw before reaching Vogler. Over a thousand soldiers occupy the camp—a whole army.  

This is a camp of Red Dragon Army soldiers. **Should the characters attempt to approach the camp,** a patrol of three baaz draconians and two Dragon Army soldiers draws near. The draconians are hooded and look like Humanoid soldiers from afar, but a character who engages in melee combat with them discovers their true nature. If attacked, one draconian attempts to flee to camp and raise an alarm.

**Use more draconians to prevent the characters from drawing close to the camp.** Even if the camp is alerted to the characters’ presence, the draconians don’t follow the characters to Vogler.

Ultimately, when the characters or other scouts return to Vogler, they should have learned the following information:

- A significant military force is camped several miles northwest of the village.
- The force looks well organized and has vigilant patrols.
- The soldiers are a mix of humans and other hooded figures. If the characters encountered them up close, they know these hooded figures have wings and reptilian features.

> [!important]  
> The players saw the camp but did not approach so didn’t properly learn about them being draconian. Jeyev and Becklin went with them.  

---

# A Fateful Morning

Mayor Raven spends the night and next morning conferring with members of the community in the common room of the Brass Crab. The morning after the battle at High Hill, two things happen:

- The characters (or local scouts) return with news of an armed camp.
- Cudgel Ironsmile returns with information from the mercenary camp.

## Camp Reconnaissance

When the characters or other scouts return to Vogler, they’re directed to report to Mayor Raven, who has been at the Brass Crab with Becklin and other concerned villagers all night. Raven is shocked by the report about the enemy camp. She wants to know more about the nature and disposition of this force, and she’s aware Vogler can’t defend itself against anything more than a few raiders. **She’s eager to hear advice from the characters and others about how to address this potential threat.**

At the outset, Raven is inclined to **draft a letter to the commander of the camp to declare Vogler’s neutrality in all conflicts**, ask the mysterious army’s intentions, and welcome them to meet with the mayor. But before the mayor can develop a plan further, Cudgel returns.

---

## Cudgel’s Report

Cudgel Ironsmile returns to Vogler accompanied by the lieutenant of her scouts, the human Jeyev Veldrews. Cudgel shares the following information:

- She believes Jeyev and her remaining troops are loyal to her—they could have easily overpowered her if they weren’t.
- On her return, Cudgel found Jeyev and other loyal mercenaries had heard of the events at High Hill. They were told not to participate by Gragonis, but didn’t think anything of it as he was left in charge. They had restrained several soldiers loyal to Gragonis but who didn’t have orders to participate in the reenactment, or drove away those who fled after the battle.
- During the night, Jeyev’s scouts came across a large military force to the northwest of the village, much too large and organized to be a mere mercenary band. This is the same army the characters likely spotted, and Jeyev’s scouts can confirm everything from the “Sighting the Enemy” section.

---

## Vogler’s Response

Allow the characters, in consultation with the village leaders, **to determine how Vogler should respond to the mysterious army.** Becklin, Cudgel, and Raven take the following positions:

**Becklin Uth Viharin.** The knight is deeply concerned. **She’s heard rumors of strange armies in the east**, and now there’s a strange army close to her home. As the most experienced military leader in the room, she expects the worst, **but she’s trying not to panic anyone.** Play her as not being too concerned but let the players roll Insight to get a feel for how she actually feels. Make the DC fairly high, out of reach of their passives definitely.

**Cudgel Ironsmile**. Cudgel feels responsible for everything at High Hill. She gives the village the complete support of what’s left of the Ironclad Regiment. **She favours a peaceful response to the mysterious army**, but one backed by her mercenaries’ spears.

**Mayor Raven Uth Vogler**. The mayor will do anything to keep her people safe. However, **she wants more information before acting.**

> [!important]  
> To further complicate the situation, Lord Bakaris joins the group mid-conversation, insulted that he hasn’t been involved in what are clearly important discussions. However, he has no idea what the discussions are about. Bakaris cares nothing for the safety of the village, but he posits ideas that make him look important without requiring any actual effort.  

**Allow the characters to guide the decision of Vogler’s leaders,** who will largely support any plan that doesn’t involve a preemptive strike or bringing battle into the village.

---

## Voice of War

However the characters choose to respond to the army near Vogler, their plans are derailed by unexpected visitors. As the characters prepare, a messenger in black-and-red armour arrives at the River Gate. **Villagers are the first to spot the messenger, and they alert the mayor and the characters.**

When Mayor Raven and the characters arrive at the River Gate, read the following text:

> [!important]  
> Beneath the carvings of leaping fish etched into Vogler’s open wooden gate, a human in black-and-red scale mail sits astride an armoured warhorse. She holds out a rolled parchment and calls out, “Who among you speaks for this village?”  

This **Dragon Army soldier** astride a warhorse is a messenger from the Red Dragon Army. **If a character doesn’t speak up first,** Raven steps forward and takes the messenger’s letter and reads it out. The message reads as follows:

> [!important]  
> People of Vogler,By the orders of Belephaion, the Voice of Takhisis, you will quarter the soldiers of the invincible Red Dragon Army this night. Refuse and die.This is the Dragon Queen’s will.  

Characters proficient in **Religion** recognize the name Takhisis as one of the gods of Krynn, **also known as the Dragon Queen.** A cleric of Takhisis or a character who succeeds on a **DC 12** Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes a spiral symbol on the messenger’s armour as a symbol of Takhisis, the greatest of the evil gods. **This same symbol appears on all Dragon Army armour.** The characters may recognise it from the draconians they fought before Vogler.

The messenger demands the village **prepare to be occupied by Dragon Army troops that evening. In the meantime, nobody can leave the village.** If the characters press the messenger for more information, she provides none. If threatened, the soldier holds her ground and **gives a signal.** Atop the 30-foot-tall cliffs to the east of the gate, four Dragon Army soldiers appear. They use their javelins to threaten anyone who threatens the messenger or who tries to leave the village.

Mayor Raven seeks to avoid bloodshed and encourages the characters to withdraw.

---

## Resistance

The appearance of the Red Dragon Army soldiers answers many questions about the force near Vogler. Back at the Brass Crab, Mayor Raven consults with the characters, Becklin, and Cudgel. Raven sees no other option than to do as the message demands and welcome the Dragon Army. Becklin and Cudgel immediately oppose this, having witnessed the horrors of occupying forces.

Let the characters propose plans to keep the Dragon Army at bay. If they don’t suggest using the Ironclad Regiment to defend the town, Cudgel suggests it. As the mercenaries are camped north of the village, bringing them to Vogler without alerting the Dragon Army likely requires getting rid of the Dragon Army soldiers at the gate—a challenge while the soldiers hold the upper ground.

If the characters wish to sneak up on the Dragon Army soldiers, they have two options, both described in the sections that follow.

### On the Cliffs

The simplest way to reach the Dragon Army soldiers is to climb the northeastern cliffs and sneak up on them. Taking a boat downriver, landing, and sneaking back is also a viable option.

The area atop the cliffs is wooded, but an open field lies below and behind the soldiers’ position. Scaling the 30-foot-tall cliffs is simple enough, but unless they are distracted, the soldiers notice anyone climbing the cliff or approaching from another direction. If the characters reach the top of the cliff, they find four Dragon Army soldiers (see appendix B).

### The Gnomeflinger

Thornwall Keep sits directly across from the Dragon Army soldiers’ clifftop vantage. Atop Thornwall Keep sits the creation of the tinker gnome Than: a people-launching device called a gnomeflinger (described in appendix A). If using the gnomeflinger comes up, Becklin or Darrett suggests consulting with Than first.

Than is overjoyed to let the characters use the gnomeflinger. They’re so delighted that they forget they also have several safety devices called narycrashes (see appendix A). Than mentions the narycrashes only if a character raises concerns about landing after using the gnomeflinger. Than has enough narycrashes for each character to get one.

Should the characters use the gnomeflinger, it proves surprisingly effective and quiet, allowing the characters to surprise the four Dragon Army soldiers (see appendix B) atop the cliffs.

---

## Dealing with the soldiers

If the characters confront the Dragon Army soldiers on the cliffs, the messenger attempts to retreat to the Dragon Army camp on her warhorse rather than aiding her allies. With the Dragon Army soldiers gone, Cudgel is eager to ride out to meet her mercenaries. She plans to bring them back to a defensible position just north of the village. If the characters don’t attack the Dragon Army soldiers on the cliffs, skip to the “Preparing for the Worst” section.

---

## Preparing for the worst

Whether the characters drive off the Dragon Army soldiers or make other plans within town, Mayor Raven eventually seeks the characters’ council in determining how best to protect the villagers. During this conversation, Becklin, Cudgel, and Raven take the following positions:

**Becklin Uth Viharin**. Becklin has grown quiet. She wants to speak privately to the characters and Darrett after they’ve conferred with Mayor Raven and Cudgel (see the “Becklin’s Fear” section).

**Cudgel Ironsmile**. Cudgel wants only to get her troops and bring them back to Vogler. Even if they’re outnumbered, fighting is the only option in her mind.

**Mayor Raven Uth Vogler**. If the characters attacked the Dragon Army soldiers, Mayor Raven is grappling with the fact they just started a war. Otherwise, she’s frustrated by the situation and seeks advice on how to protect her people by nightfall. She refuses any suggestion involving fighting in the village.

If the characters suggest they prepare to evacuate Vogler, the mayor initially dismisses the idea, but a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces her it’s in the village’s best interest. Becklin agrees and shares the information in the “Becklin’s Fear” section. The mayor doesn’t like it but grudgingly accepts it’s the only option.

If not deterred, Cudgel and Jeyev either ride or sneak out of Vogler to rally their mercenaries.

### **Becklin’s Fear**

If the characters don’t suggest preparing Vogler for evacuation, Becklin pulls them and Darrett aside for a private conversation. She shares the following concerns:

- Becklin has heard about war and unstoppable armies in the east. She fears these Red Dragon Army soldiers are part of that greater force.
- She’s lived in Vogler for decades and knows its people aren’t soldiers. They’d need weeks of training and a hundred more professional soldiers to stand a chance in any conflict.
- She suggests readying the villagers to evacuate at a moment’s notice in case other plans fail.
- Evacuees can follow the river to safety in Kalaman (detailed below).

Becklin asks the characters to help convince Mayor Raven of this idea. If the characters already suggested this idea to the mayor, Becklin supports them, adding the points here to the argument. If both the characters and Becklin advocate for evacuating the village, Mayor Raven begrudgingly agrees.

Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (History) check or who ask a resident of Vogler about the city of Kalaman can any of the information from the “Knowledge of Kalaman” section at the start of chapter 4.

---

## Planning to Evacuate

Once the village leaders agree to prepare for evacuation, the people of Vogler have much to do. Becklin focuses on getting information about the Red Dragon Army and shoring up local defenses. Mayor Raven asks for the characters’ and Darrett’s help organizing the evacuation, tasking them with the following:

- Help her inform the villagers of the situation by collecting everyone in the village circle.
- Assess how many ships the village has and roughly how many villagers they can carry.
- Instruct the villagers how to get to safety.
- Keep the villagers calm.

Mayor Raven and Darrett cooperate with any plans the characters have, as long as they clearly help prepare for escape and don’t risk any villagers’ lives. However, the mayor doesn’t want to start the evacuation until absolutely necessary, allowing villagers time to prepare and safely evacuate together.

### Informing the Villagers

The characters can easily summon most of Vogler’s people to the village circle, likely by going door to door or by ringing the village circle’s bell. When the villagers have gathered, Mayor Raven addresses the crowd. Read the following text:

> [!important]  
> Colorful Kingfisher Festival decorations still cover the village circle and the festival stage. Unlike the day before, the people collected in the village center are somber, muttering in worried tones as Mayor Raven takes the stage.The mayor doesn’t mince words: “A dangerous army is headed for Vogler. The Ironclad Regiment will do what it can to defend Vogler, but we must be ready to flee.”Following the mayor’s report, the locals stand in stunned silence. Then their questions come in a wave of shouting, anger, and fear.  

With a successful DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, the characters can help the mayor regain control of the crowd by speaking in support or explaining evacuation plans. Otherwise, it takes the mayor over an hour to placate the community and get evacuation preparations underway.

At your discretion, Lord Bakaris or Bakaris the Younger might speak out and try to undermine the mayor and the characters. If so, the villagers reject the evacuation plans until a character counters Bakaris by roleplaying or succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.

Once the villagers have accepted the evacuation plans, they assist Mayor Raven, Darrett, and the characters in preparing to evacuate to Kalaman, understanding time is short.

### Short Ship Supply

A character who spends an hour inspecting the ships in Vogler’s wharf estimates the vessels there could transport only two hundred of the village’s four hundred residents. Let the characters concoct ways to solve this problem. If they don’t initially have ideas, characters can make skill checks to identify solutions like the following. A character proficient with water vehicles makes these checks with advantage.

**Boat Made of Boats**. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) check formulates a plan to use rope and rings of small boats to corral floating masses of logs, creating several large rafts capable of holding two hundred more villagers. With the help of locals, this simple plan takes three hours to complete.

**Personal Fleet**. If a character asks Vogler’s fishers for help and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the character can convince the villagers to lend their personal vessels to the evacuation: boats in need of simple repairs, boats collecting dust in villagers’ sheds, and even boats serving as decorations in homes. Given two hours, the villagers can find enough boats to fit one hundred more people.

**Repurposed Ferry**. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices the ferry crossing on the Vingaard River has a series of rafts and small boats on a pulley system. The mechanism can be broken down in two hours, freeing up vessels for one hundred people.

### Battle Plans

Early in the afternoon, Cudgel returns to Vogler. She shares the following information:

- Cudgel has directed the Ironclad Regiment to hold a position north of the village. The mercenaries believe they can, for a time, defend against a larger force.
- She hopes they won’t have to fight. With any luck, a show of force will convince the Dragon Army that Vogler isn’t an easy target.
- Just in case, her soldiers set up a small rear command tent near the River Gate. She’s posted a messenger there so the village can send word to her troops as needed.
- She asks Becklin to join her at the front. She hopes if a Knight of Solamnia appears on the field, the enemy will hesitate to provoke the knighthood.

Mayor Raven and Becklin support Cudgel’s choices, and the knight agrees with her friend’s plan.

**Defenders of Vogler**. This plan leaves the village and its escape operation undefended except for the handful of remaining militia members and a few tough fishers. Becklin and Cudgel ask the characters and Darrett to remain in the village with the mayor. They want to ensure that if any enemies get past the Ironclad Regiment, the villagers have protection.

### Becklin’s Request

During the conversation about battle plans, the character with the highest passive Wisdom (Insight) score realizes Becklin is keeping something back. She won’t say anything in front of Cudgel, Mayor Raven, or Darrett, but if approached in private, she thanks the character and asks them to do her a favor. A large wooden box is under her bed in Thornwall Keep. She doesn’t tell them what it holds but asks the characters to fetch the box and give it to Darrett once he safely escapes town.

The characters can easily retrieve the box from Becklin’s quarters at any point before the “Invasion Encounters” section. The sturdy wooden box weighs about 70 pounds and bears no markings other than a simple kingfisher emblem on the lid. If the characters open the box, they find it holds a suit of Solamnic plate armor.

If the characters follow Becklin’s instructions, they won’t give the box to Darrett until after the evacuation. If they instead do so before leaving town, see the “Darrett’s Armor” section in chapter 4.

## The Enemy Sighted

After Cudgel has returned and the characters have organized Vogler’s evacuation, a local farmer rides into the village circle. The farmer reports seeing hundreds of soldiers on the road, headed toward Vogler. The adventure unfolds in one of two ways from here:

> [!important]  
> They fucking circumvented all the cool shit :’( Going to need to find a reason to make Becklin and Cudgel leave, and Becklin must give the armour to the characters, to give to Darrett. I think Becklin must decide to travel to Solamnia and discuss with the Knights. Perhaps she gets captured as she travels towards Vogler from Kalaman. Cudgel goes with her?

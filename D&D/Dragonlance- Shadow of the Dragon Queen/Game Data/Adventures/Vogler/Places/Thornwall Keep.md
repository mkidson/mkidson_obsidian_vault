The ruins of an ancient Solamnic keep perch on a rocky rise at the western edge of town. Thornwall Keep’s steward, the knight Becklin Uth Viharin (introduced in the “Final Farewell” section), maintains the keep. Partially ruined walls surround the keep’s three-story tower. The tower’s ground level holds a small library and a collection of local relics: over forty pieces of rusty tools and armour. The second floor holds the quarters of Becklin’s squire, Darrett Highwater (introduced in the “Parting Gift” section later in this chapter). Becklin’s austere room lies on the uppermost story; from there, a ladder leads to the keep’s crenelated roof.

Vogler’s resident tinker gnome, Than, built an elaborate catapult-like contraption on the roof of the keep. A friend of Becklin and Darrett, Than occasionally drops by to fine-tune this device, called a gnomeflinger (detailed in appendix A). Though it looks like a weapon of war, the contraption is a mode of rapid transportation originally devised by the tinker gnomes of Mount Nevermind. Becklin tolerates the gnomeflinger—and the noise of Than’s occasional early-morning tinkering—because she sees the catapult-shaped device as a deterrent against attack.

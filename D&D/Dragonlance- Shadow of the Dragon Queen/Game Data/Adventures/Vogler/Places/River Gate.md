Those who enter Vogler from the north pass through the unguarded River Gate, a 15-foot-tall wooden archway carved with two leaping fish on its frame. Over the years, locals have etched the coin-sized scales of these fish with prayers for bountiful fishing. Two large wooden doors stand within the arch, but they havenâ€™t been closed for years and are embedded in the surrounding dirt.

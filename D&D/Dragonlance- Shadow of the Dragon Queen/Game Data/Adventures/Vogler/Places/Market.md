Across from Voglerâ€™s busy wharf spreads the village market. Amid this collection of stalls, vendors sell fresh river fish, fishing supplies, crafts, the bounty of local farms, and all manner of mundane equipment. One notable stall is that of Froswin (chaotic good, kender commoner), who sells intricate fish-bone puppets she designs in the shapes of animals and sea serpents.

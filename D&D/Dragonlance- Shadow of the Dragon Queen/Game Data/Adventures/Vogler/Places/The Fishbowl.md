After a long day on the river, many of Vogler’s fishers gather at the Fishbowl to tell tales, quench their thirst, and indulge in baked fish pies. The cramped but well-kept tavern is known for its savory baked goods more than its weak ale. The Fishbowl’s proprietor is the elderly Elthar (neutral good, human commoner), whom most locals call Uncle.

- A very homely feel
- Fishing accessories line the walls as decoration
- Behind the bar, a board has the number 4 written on it in chalk
- Depending on the time of day, the bar may be full of the locals on the way home from work on the docks and the river.
- In the corner sits a man on his own. His hood is up and his face obscured. In front of him is a half-full mug of ale that he doesn’t seem to touch

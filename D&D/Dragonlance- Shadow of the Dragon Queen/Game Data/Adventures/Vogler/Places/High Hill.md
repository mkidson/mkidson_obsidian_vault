High Hill stands a mile north of Vogler. Centuries ago, Solamnic and Istarian forces clashed here, and legends claim the spirits of fallen knights haunt the hill and watch over the town. Each year, the Kingfisher Festival’s re-enactment of the battle serves as a reminder of the village’s history and nominally honours any spirits lingering at the battlefield.

Along the road north of Vogler, a mile past High Hill, lies a mercenary camp. Known as the Ironclad Regiment, the soldiers here are under the command of Captain Ridomir “Cudgel” Ironsmile (introduced in the “Final Farewell” section). Cudgel is a friend of the deceased Ispin Greenshield and many others in town, and she brought her company to Vogler a week ago to attend Ispin’s funeral. She volunteered her band to take part in the annual reenactment of the Battle of High Hill—her attempt to lift the village’s spirits after their loss.

During the day, Cudgel remains in the camp with her lieutenants—the half-ogre Gragonis and the human Jeyev Veldrews—along with several dozen mercenaries. The soldiers spend most of the day participating in drills. At night, they keep to themselves, lounging and playing dice. They’re under strict orders from Cudgel not to interfere with the locals.

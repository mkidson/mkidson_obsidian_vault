# Wheelwatch Outpost

Wheelwatch, Kalaman’s southernmost outpost, has been taken by Red Dragon Army forces. Darrett requests the characters participate in retaking it. Start this section only after you’ve run any desired events in the “Missions for Kalaman” section.

## Preparing for the Mission

Darrett brings the characters word that the Dragon Army has taken one of Kalaman’s border forts. He has the following information:

- Wheelwatch Outpost stands near the border with the land of Estwilde. The fort supplies Kalaman’s forces that patrol the border.
- The fort, which lies twenty-four miles southeast of the city, has been taken by the Dragon Army.
- Raven has been aiding Kalaman’s military. She was given command of a force to retake the outpost, but that force is small and inexperienced.
- Darrett asks the characters to join Raven and support her in retaking the fort.

Darrett arranges a meeting between the characters and Raven later that day. During the meeting, Raven provides a sketch of Wheelwatch Outpost featuring the information on map 4.2. Raven also informs the characters of the following:

- The fort’s tall northwest tower is a watchtower with a commanding view of the surrounding land.
- All four corner fortifications are equipped with horns that sentries use to raise an alarm.
- Raven doesn’t know how many Dragon Army soldiers occupy the fort.
- After Raven and her troops leave Kalaman, it will take them eight hours to get in position in a secluded grove a mile from the fort.

Raven suggests the characters slip into the fort and open a gate without raising the alarm. However, she’s amenable to any plan that doesn’t risk the lives of her troops or destroy the fort.

### Reconnaisance

Wheelwatch Outpost lies south of where the streams known as the Gravel Run and the Raiding Rill meet. Read the following description when the characters come within sight of the fort:

> [!important]  
> In the distance, a squat stone fortress rises from one of the last patches of green before the rocky scrubland of Estwilde. Its tall wooden gates are flanked by crenelated battlements and solid watchtowers. Torchlight shines through the fort’s windows, and every so often, armoured figures make their way along the walls.  

If a character spends eight hours observing the fort, they determine that patrols in the corner towers switch watch duty every six hours, and they can make a **DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation)** check to estimate how many Dragon Army soldiers are in the fort. On a successful check, the character accurately estimates about **twenty** Dragon Army soldiers are in the fort. On a failed check, they estimate double this number. If the check **fails by 10 or more**, the character is spotted, and after 10 minutes, a squad of six Dragon Army soldiers leaves the fort to investigate the character’s position. If the soldiers find the character or don’t return, the fort goes on alert (see the “Wheelwatch Alert” section).

### **Wheelwatch Features**

Wheelwatch Outpost has the following features:

**Ceilings.** The ceilings in the outpost’s interior chambers are **10 feet high.**

**Gates.** The outpost’s **15-foot-tall, reinforced wooden gates** can be opened or closed only by the gate controls nearest them (see area W1 for a description of these controls). Each gate door is a Huge object with **AC 17, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.**

**Light.** Torches provide bright light throughout the fort, except for area W5, which is dimly lit.

**Walls.**  
The walls of Wheelwatch are  
**20 feet high**, with towers and fortifications adding an additional **10 feet** for each floor. A character can climb the walls by succeeding on a **DC 14 Strength (Athletics)** check. The windows in these walls are 6-inch-wide arrow slits.

## Wheelwatch Locations

### W1: Courtyard

> [!important]  
> The fort’s courtyard holds several small structures with wooden roofs. Stairs climb from the dirt yard to the fort’s west and east battlements. To the north and south stand solid wooden gates reinforced with iron bands. Along the wall next to each gate is a metal mechanism with a prominent winch.  

At any given time, three Dragon Army soldiers are in the courtyard patrolling, training, or running errands.

**Gate Controls.** The north and south gates each have a mechanism to open and close that gate. Unlocking a gate mechanism requires using one of the outpost’s three gate keys or succeeding on a **DC 14 Dexterity** check using **thieves’ tools**. Once unlocked, the winch on the controls moves freely. It takes **1 minute** to fully open or close the gates using the controls. Opening a gate attracts the attention of all creatures in areas **W1, W2, area W3, and area W4.**

### W2: South Guard Towers

> [!important]  
> Two soldiers stand at this stone room’s narrow windows. A horn hangs on the wall between the doors.  

The south guard towers are identical. In each, two Dragon Army soldiers (see appendix B) watch the surrounding land.

### W3: Northwest Guard Tower

> [!important]  
> Narrow windows line the walls of this bare stone room. In the southeast corner, a ladder climbs to the floor above. On the wall next to it hangs a metal horn.  

The northwest tower is the largest of Wheelwatch’s guard towers. Its second floor is identical to the first, accessed by the ladder here.

On the first floor, a sivak draconian (see appendix B) stands guard in human guise. It’s using its Shape Theft reaction to take the form of a Kalaman soldier it killed. If slain, it shifts back to its true form. The sivak draconian has a small spell book. 

Two Dragon Army soldiers (see appendix B) guard the second floor. Their alarm horn hangs on the south wall by the ladder.

### Wheelwatch Alert

The Dragon Army troops occupying Wheelwatch Outpost are on the lookout for danger. Use the following details to guide when the Dragon Army soldiers go on alert and how that affects their behaviour.

**Alarm Horns**

Each of the outpost’s corner guard posts (areas W2, area W3, and area W4) is equipped with an alarm horn. If a sentry in one of these areas notices enemies or unusual activity, they attempt to sound an alarm horn 1 round later on their turn. Once an alarm horn is sounded, the fort goes on alert.

**Alert**

If a threat is detected, the eight Dragon Army soldiers in area W5 rush to meet it (or gather in area W1 if the source is unclear). While on alert, Dragon Army troops have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Troops remain on alert for twelve hours after spotting an enemy or finding other clear signs of enemy activity. In the case of other threats, troops remain on alert until the danger passes or is identified as a false alarm.

**Impostors**

Characters who wear Dragon Army armor have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as Dragon Army soldiers.

**Dragonnel Rider**

The Dragon Army has a secret weapon in area W8: a Dragon Army dragonnel and its Dragon Army officer rider (see appendix B for both stat blocks). If the characters don’t discover the pair first, the dragonnel and its rider take to the air and attack at a dramatic moment—likely after the characters have overcome most of the fort’s forces or as they work to open the gates in area W1.

### W4: Northeast Fortification

> [!important]  
> A U-shaped hall lined with narrow windows runs around this fortification. Along a wall bearing racks of weapons and a horn hanging from a leather strap, doors lead into an interior room.  

Two baaz draconians (see appendix B) keep watch in the hall here. Their alarm horn hangs from the north weapon rack. If battle breaks out here, the Dragon Army soldiers in area W5 come to investigate after **2 rounds**.

_**Treasure**_. The weapon racks hold dozens of weapons that belonged to Kalaman’s forces before the fort was taken. One rack also has a hoopak staff (see appendix A) taken from Elgo (who’s imprisoned in area W6). Mounted over the south rack is a shiny lance etched with images of dragons; made of tin, this decoration is useless in combat.

### W5: Barracks

> [!important]  
> Soft lantern light dimly outlines six two-level sets of bunk beds filling this modest barracks. A footlocker sits beneath each set of bunks.  

At any given time, eight Dragon Army soldiers (see appendix B) rest here. They swap places with on-duty guards throughout the day. If they **hear battle in area W4** or an **alarm horn** sounds, they rush to support their allies after **2 rounds.**

_**Treasure**_. Under each of the sets of bunks is a simple wooden footlocker. Each holds two sets of common clothes and 10 gp. One footlocker also contains a silvered longsword, while another contains a holy symbol of Takhisis and a key for the gate controls in area W1.

### W6: Prison

If the alarm hasn’t been raised, a Dragon Army officer (see appendix B) named **Ardlic Vanse** is seated at a desk, writing a report. He commands the forces here. He is terrified of his commander, Kansaldi Fire-Eyes, and **will sacrifice his life and the lives of his troops to keep control of the fort.**

**North Cell.** This locked cell holds a neutral human Kalaman soldier (see appendix B) named Lanal Brint. He was sleeping off a night of drink in this cell when the outpost was taken. He tells the characters anything they want to know about the fortress—such as how the gate mechanisms work—but only after he’s separated from Elgo (see below).

**South Cell.** This locked cell holds Elgo Duckditcher, a chaotic good kender skirmisher (see appendix B) who considers herself a famous explorer and avoider of fowl. The Red Dragon Army imprisoned her here after she insisted she be allowed to explore the fort. In the days since, she has told Lanal every story she knows twice and has declared him her adopted cousin. She’s convinced his name is Flannel, though, and she won’t hear otherwise—she knows her own cousin’s name. If freed, Elgo won’t leave until she recovers her hoopak (found in area W4).

_**Treasure**_. The papers on the desk include Commander Vanse’s daily reports, along with orders to hold Wheelwatch at all costs, signed “Dragon Highmaster Kansaldi Fire-Eyes.” A desk drawer holds **thieves’ tools** confiscated from Elgo and **200 gp.**

Commander Vanse carries an iron ring with keys to the cells in this area and to the **gates in area W1**.

### W7: Storage

The storage room’s barrels contain enough food, water, and other supplies to sustain the outpost for a month. A character who spends **5 minutes** searching the supplies and succeeds on a **DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation)** check finds a dusty case containing six [flasks of alchemist’s fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/alchemists-fire-flask).

### W8: Stable

A character who listens at the door to the stable and succeeds on a **DC 14 Wisdom (Perception)** check hears something large moving inside.

> [!important]  
> Filled with stalls and supplies for horses, this stable stinks of large animals and blood. The ground is covered with the scattered skeletons of two horses. Looming over them, something large, red, and reptilian picks through their bones.  

A Dragon Army dragonnel and its rider, a Dragon Army officer, are in this stable (see appendix B for both stat blocks). If the characters enter, the dragonnel recognizes them as intruders and attacks. This is likely the first time the characters have seen a creature this similar to a dragon. A character who succeeds on a **DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature)** check knows the creature is a **dragonnel**, a wild lesser cousin of the storied dragons that disappeared from Krynn.

If the dragonnel and its rider already took flight (see “Wheelwatch Alert”), this area is empty.

### W9: Kitchens

> [!important]  
> Cooking supplies fill this room. Opposite a table covered in cutlery and scrawny carrots, a human soldier wearing a stained apron over his armor minds two pots bubbling on a lit stove.  

A Dragon Army soldier (see appendix B) prepares a meal here: a watery soup, heavy on pepper.

_**Treasure**_. The cook’s prized possession is a **pair of salt and pepper shakers** worth 20 gp. They’re lovingly carved to resemble **black and white dragons**.

## Completing the Mission

Once the characters open Wheelwatch’s gates, Raven sends in her troops to clear out any remaining Dragon Army resistance. She suggests the characters rest and recuperate, then return to Kalaman with a letter from Raven informing Marshal Vendri of their victory.

Any Dragon Army soldier taken captive during the mission makes one of the following claims:

**Futile Victory.** The Dragon Army is certain to retake Wheelwatch at any time. Kalaman’s defenders should **surrender now**.

**Gathering Threat.** The Red Dragon Army’s leader, Dragon Highmaster Kansaldi Fire-Eyes, is still preparing her forces. **Her troops will subdue the region** before turning to greater conquests.

**Messenger.** The **dragonnel** stationed here was a **mere messenger**. When war truly comes to the region, red wings will darken the skies.

---
Once they're done here, they will travel back to Kalaman, victorious, but it won't quite be as they'd hoped.

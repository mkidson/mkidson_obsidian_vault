| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | A band of crew members with purple armbands and fabulous eye makeup — the Bloomridge Dandies — stop the party to tell the characters they’re watching them and to keep their noses clean.             |
| 2   | A reporter from Kalaman’s Mouth waves the party over, hoping they’ll help her get information for a story about some outrageous conspiracy.                                                           |
| 3   | A man offers to sell the party a glass eye. Later, a drunk stumbles away from the Blushing Mermaid tavern, searching every gutter for his missing eye.                                                |
| 4   | An undertaker from Candulhallow’s Arrangements approaches and asks if the party has considered undeath insurance, ominously warning about liabilities should their corpses commit post-death damages. |
| 5   | Scalm Shilvin of Eastway Expeditions mocks a party member’s armour. She offers to apply “raptor repellent” at the discounted price of 10 gp.                                                          |
| 6   | A man with a dreadful fear of rats races down the street and slams into the party, having witnessed a bunch of rats feeding on something in an alley.                                                 |
| 7   | The druid Torimesh offers one party member a strange symbol stained on a piece of bark. He tells the party that the Drawing Tree sent it as a message.                                                |
| 8   | The city’s sketchiest tea enthusiast invites the party into Jopalin’s for a free cup of the café’s special blend.                                                                                     |
| 9   | A rough-and-tumble woman gets chummy with the party and tells characters that Laraelra Thundreth is hiring bouncers at the Low Lantern.                                                               |
| 10  | A winding crack in the street shrieks when a specific party member steps on it. The crack runs for blocks, tracing back to Mandorcai’s Mansion.                                                       |
| 11  | Two drunk sailors invite the characters to join them in singing a well-known shanty called _Really Big Oysters_, but one quickly keels over backwards and the other goes to help him.                 |
| 12  | A reeking, damp “druid” flees from the direction of the harbour. If stopped, the panicked man claims “Something hatched!”                                                                             |

|5|A merchant giving away samples of her wares offers each party member a free cigar.|
|6|A street artist offers to sketch one of the characters for the modest fee of 3 copper pieces. The sketch isn’t particularly good.|
|7|A doddering old man claiming to be a mage approaches them asking if they want to see a magic trick. He does what’s clearly minor illusion to make it look like a coin appears behind an ear. He tells them to spread the word of “Fizban’s Follies”, his magic show. If they ask around, nobody has heard of this show.|
|8|Ominous, disembodied whispers reach the party’s ears.|

## Danthelon’s Dancing Axe

This two-story shop sells everything an adventurer might need, from weapons and armour to rowboats and mobile monster cages. Presiding over the crammed shelves is Entharl Danthelon, a neutral good male dwarf commoner who claims to have been an adventurer once himself, as evidenced by the magical flying axe that guards his shop at night. Customers are inevitably treated to the story of the grateful elven princess who enchanted the axe for him as a reward for a daring adventure undertaken on her behalf.

In truth, Danthelon’s “dancing axe” is actually a tame [stirge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17023-stirge) wrapped in the illusion of a double-bladed axe, which Danthelon sets loose each night. The illusion is courtesy of Yssra Brackrel, a neutral female half-elf mage and brilliant hairstylist who rents out the shop’s attic. Yssra’s cantankerousness is as legendary as the shop’s flying axe, and anyone seeking just her spellcasting is subject to a frank and unflattering critique of their current coiffure.

While Danthelon may never have been a real adventurer, he loves associating with them, and constantly keeps his ears open for rumours and opportunities, which he happily passes along to paying customers.

> [!important]  
> Danthelon’s Dancing Axe is a two-story shop just south of the harbour. If there at night, the characters see a menacing-looking floating axe defending the entrance. As you enter, you see a large interior, packed to the brim with adventuring gear. Grappling hooks, daggers, rope, anything you might need. Towards the back of the shop are stairs to the upper floor, but a chain sits across the entrance with a sign that reads “No entry except for haircuts”.Tinkering with one of the shelves is a dwarven man wearing studded leather armour and a dagger at his hip. He looks like he’s prepared to adventure at any time.  

A **DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check** will reveal that everything looks a little bit too refined and clean. Perhaps this gear has never seen any actual use.

> [!important]  
> “Hullo there, adventurers”, he says in a way that makes you think he actually says this to anyone that enters the shop, “how can I be of service to you?”  

Danthelon can sell them anything from [this page](https://www.thievesguild.cc/shops/shop-adventurer). He will haggle.

## Eastway Expeditions

Eastway Expeditions used to buy dubious exploration and dungeon-delving gear on the cheap — often from hollow-eyed early retirees — before marking it up to sell to optimistic would-be heroes. Scalm Shilvin , a neutral female elf spy, is the shop’s slick, tail-coat-wearing kagonesti elf proprietor. She made a decent living from her business, but all that changed when Kalaman forged a lucrative trade alliance with the merchants of Khur as the quickest way to get there is by boat, not over land. This is thanks to the mountains in the way.

Shilvin quickly capitalized on the interest in Khur, with its history of being close to where Istar was before it sunk into the Blood Sea, outfitting droves of green adventurers and directing them aboard ships headed to the region. Most never returned — leaving her uncertain of whether any of her “storm-proof” or “dinosaur-deterring” equipment worked as she’d marketed. Eventually the local government got involved after several overly ambitious nobles vanished on ventures hastily outfitted by Eastway Expeditions. Now Shilvin can sell her modest selection of goods and any storm-related gear only after a ten-day waiting period, helping to ensure that fewer citizens rush off to Khur unprepared. To make up for the resulting loss of business, Shilvin has made connections with several trading (and piratical) ventures in regular need of crew. Eastway Expeditions has since gained a low-key reputation for helping people get out of the city fast, so long as they don’t care overly much where they go.

> [!important]  
> As you enter this small shop, you notice that the shelves are filled to the absolute brim with adventuring gear. A quick look reveals that while this all looks to be close to things you would find in a normal adventuring shop, they all seem to have modifications and extra bits bolted on. Signs on the displays claim things to be “Entirely waterproof” and “squid-repellant”.Behind an ornate desk is a young kagonesti elf wearing coattails and a top-hat. She smiles at you and says “Welcome to Eastway Expeditions. If you are planning to traverse the Blood Sea of Istar, you’ll need these wares or you won’t get too far.”  

Everything in this shop is the usual price for the base item, but Scalm claims that’s a good deal as they all have extra features. For all these devices, when used, roll a d20 and on a 1, the item breaks. Scalm will not haggle, asserting that her products are already cheaper than they should be.

|Item|Price|
|---|---|
|A grappling hook that claims to be highly effective for latching onto the sides of ships, for boarding. Advantage when grappling onto wooden things.|2 gp|
|A light crossbow with a harpoon attachment, for skewering fish or larger animals. Can take normal ammo, but can also be used to harpoon something, at which point the rope can be tugged on etc. Harpoon max distance is 30 ft.|25 gp|

Come up with some fun little trinket/food stalls

## Wyhan’s Apothecary

Wyhan (lawful evil, human mage) is a black-robed Mage of High Sorcery. Though supposedly retired, she keeps a shop that deals in wares few in Kalaman need. Wyhan’s Apothecary sells the occasional good-luck charm, but those who know what to ask for might gain access to the apothecary’s back room, which houses esoteric spell components. The “Message for a Mage” section later in this chapter provides more details on Wyhan and her shop.

## Meulara’s Oddities

Meulara’s Oddities is a small shop piled with trinkets. Its shopkeeper, Meulara (chaotic good, kender commoner), is a silver-haired woman with a bright smile. Meulara claims to know every kender in the city, and most kender new to town are directed to her so they can swap stories and news from their travels.

# Entertainment

## Oasis Theatre

Theater owner and director Jonas Goodnight, a chaotic neutral male human spy, puts on shows even more outrageous than his magnificently crafted outfits. Productions involve everything from live monsters to powerful illusion magic, while also showcasing the most talented performers in the city. Actors and musicians perform their songs and monologues from atop flaming trapezes or human towers, while acrobats shock the audience with physical feats bordering on the supernatural.

Even lowbrow theatregoers unable to decipher Goodnight’s artistic genius can appreciate his flagrant breaking of taboos, with risqué burlesque and satirical scripts mocking everyone from the dukes to Nine-Fingers Keene herself. The fact that these performances sometimes go terribly awry, with monsters breaking loose or a broken piece of equipment sending a performer plummeting into the crowd, only adds to the excitement, and nobles and common folk alike vie for seats at the theater’s afternoon-only performances. Ticket prices are decided capriciously and on the spot by Goodnight, varying wildly between any given individual.

While Goodnight is always looking for new performers, at the moment he needs more than just a talented bard or contortionist. The cost of putting on his outrageous shows has landed him deep in debt, and his compulsive need to roast every potential patron or ally in the city hasn’t helped matters.

# Inns/Taverns/Brothels (ITB)

## Blushing Mermaid

The Blushing Mermaid is known as the best tavern and inn in Kalaman for those looking to get their teeth kicked in, or to kick in someone else’s. Always one spilled drink away from a brawl, the bar is the sort of place most don’t visit unless they’re well-armed or with a lot of friends — preferably both. The place takes its name from the life-sized wooden mermaid hanging above the incongruous reception desk, a dozen blackened and withered hands nailed to its body — souvenirs left by those who refused to pay their bill.

Beyond the combination lobby and common room, the Blushing Mermaid is a confusing maze of wings and oddly interconnected floors, hiding dozens of small and shabby rooms and at least four levels of cellars. Few people bother to sleep at the Mermaid, due in part to its operators’ loud pronouncement that they aren’t responsible for any losses, including those of life and limb. Instead, its plethora of back rooms and antechambers act as de facto offices for the menagerie of shady characters who spend their days drinking here. Ostensibly retired sailors, the bar’s regulars are in fact contacts for a variety of unsavoury organizations, from smugglers and bandits to fences and drug dealers. Those looking to do business with the underworld find that a handful of silver in the Mermaid can open doors, but the wrong word can find you dumped unconscious in the alley out back. While the Mermaid’s criminal aspects are an open secret, the place is well connected enough that the city guard traditionally leaves it alone.

> [!important]  
> A grizzled old human male mans the reception desk. He has piercings all over his face and an eyepatch over his left eye. He welcomes them with “Welcome to the Blushing Mermaid. All are welcome, provided you pay your bills.” And he points up at the hands hanging from the sign above him.  

The man’s name is Char Blackhouse.

## Jopalin’s Teahouse

After taking over from his father, a neutral evil male half-elf thug named Jopalin transitioned this building from a seedy tavern to a thriving, upscale teahouse. Many were shocked by the growth of such a sophisticated establishment among the port’s lowbrow customers, but no one can deny the addictive nature of the half-elf proprietor’s special blend. Jopalin includes sable moonflower leaves in his tea, creating a subtle, slow-building addiction among those who drink it. Many never realize what’s happening, knowing only that they deeply crave his tea above all others, and for those who do uncover the scam, it’s often too late, leaving them with no choice but to keep coming back. Jopalin personally watches over the customers and ensures that only those who seem vulnerable get the “special” tea, avoiding suspicion from any who might decide to fight back if the truth were to come out.

Jopalin also runs a more traditionally squalid moonflower den in the shop’s damp basement, catering to ordinary addicts and those who’ve become so reliant on the tea that they can no longer pass as normal customers. These sad cases are shuffled in through an entrance in the building next door to avoid suspicion, where a group of thugs presides over several dozen filthy cots, collecting Jopalin’s fees and dispensing his moonflower supply. The paranoid Jopalin himself lives in a lavish and heavily booby-trapped loft above the café.

> [!important]  
> The teahouse is a smallish shop in the east of town. As you enter, you see a number of people of all creeds and classes enjoying the wares. A few of the people look a little skittish and protective of their drinks as they see you. Attending the customers is someone who looks entirely out of place here. Jopalin is a half-elf who looks like an absolute thug: tattoos up and down his arm and on his face, scars all over. He is, however, wearing a floral apron and carrying around dainty tea-sets and being a perfect host to the customers.  

## The Low Lantern

This old, three-masted ship rocks gently in the water alongside Stormshore Street Dock on the harbor’s eastern side. A notorious fest hall and tavern, the ship is no longer seaworthy and is in desperate need of repair.

On warm days and evenings, respectable clients can sit at tables on the upper deck beneath hanging lanterns, smoking and drinking between wagers, while a more raucous crowd congregates around bars and gambling tables on the decks below.

## Eomane House

The four Eomane siblings are notorious throughout Kalaman for the scandalous masked revels hosted at their manor. Nysene Eomane, a lawful evil female human noble, likes to extend invitations to hopeful social climbers from other districts, intending to trap them at her parties. Lacking Watch tokens, Nysene’s guests face a night in the Citadel’s cells or worse if they’re caught in the Upper City after dark. They therefore have little choice but to let her and her friends make cruel sport of them until they can escape at daybreak. As yet, none of Nysene’s playthings have suffered any real harm, but her games grow ever bolder and more vicious, and it’s only a matter of time until someone is seriously hurt.

While Nysene’s siblings — Dolandre, Rusorra, and Trenteller — view this behavior as embarrassing and unworthy of her station, they also don’t care enough to stop her, since the victims are social inferiors whose welfare isn’t worth interrupting their own revels. It’s also likely that her siblings are in denial about the true extent of their sister’s sadism. Some of the city’s evil faiths have begun to take notice of Nysene’s games, however, with Bane’s faith seeing a talent worth cultivating in Eomane House.

## The Undercellar

Beneath the City Market is a maze of storage chambers, ale cellars, and cobwebbed tunnels known collectively as the Undercellar. Archways, many with iron-barred gates and rusty but functional locks, connect one cobbled chamber to the next. Some tunnels ascend to street-level buildings, while others open through grates and sewer covers to the streets themselves. At least two dozen ways into and out of the Undercellar exist, although only a few are widely known, and some are deliberately kept secret.

Most Baldurians know of the Undercellar as a seedy speakeasy. The Watch and the Flaming Fist never police the Undercellar, leaving it to a gang of masked toughs who call themselves the Cellarers to enforce order. This near-total absence of the law makes the Undercellar a popular place of business for unsavory characters who would never risk being caught in the Upper City otherwise. Their “indulgence rooms” offer gambling, intoxicants, and pit fights between animals — such as giant sewer rats pitted against dog-sized spiders. Most ordinary citizens who venture into the Undercellar for a taste of danger keep to these areas.

However, those in search of more serious danger can generally find it. Several gray and black marketeers hold heavily reinforced, Guild-approved secure rooms in the Undercellar, from which they deal in weapons, illicit disguises, counterfeit Watch tokens, rare poisons, and other contraband. Access to these dealers requires Guild approval or significant bribes to the Cellarers.

In addition to harboring illicit businesses, the Undercellar is rumored to run throughout much of the Upper City. Its secret tunnels wind beneath numerous patriar manors, banks, businesses, and even the High Hall itself, connecting through false walls in wine cellars and basements throughout the district. Some of the walls are supposedly thin enough for an eavesdropper to overhear all manner of sensitive plans and scandalous liaisons.

A gaunt, bearded man named Heltur “Ribbons” Ribbond, a neutral evil male human assassin, rules the Undercellar with an oily, too-affable manner and a wide grin that only makes his scar-seamed face more menacing. Ribbons has never been seen to lose his temper, even when hurling knives and bottles with deadly accuracy at unruly guests. It’s taken as an article of faith that he must be a kingpin or otherwise high-placed within the Guild.

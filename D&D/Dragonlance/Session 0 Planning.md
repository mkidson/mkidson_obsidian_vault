Once they have ideas for characters:

- Find out which characters will be godly, which want to join the Mages of High Sorcery, or which are neither
- All need to think up their connection to Ispin Greenshield and ideally think of a story (the more far-fetched the better) that they tell fondly of their time together
- Maybe even give them their letter before session 0 ends
- Characters should be level 1 but be prepped to jump to level 2 mid-session
- characters should be “willing to join a war/army”

For the “Broken Silence” prelude:

- Which god do you worship?
- Have you worshipped for a while or is this going to be the first encounter?
- remind them that the power of the gods has not been seen on Krynn for centuries

Wherever they are in the world of Krynn, the characters receive a letter addressed to them. It reads:

> [! Note]
> Dear friend,
> I am Becklin Uth Viharin. I’ve heard much about you from our mutual friend, Ispin Greenshield. It grieves me to share the news that our dear friend Ispin passed away peacefully here at his home in Vogler. May fortune and the old gods protect his soul.
> 
> Ispin’s friends are holding a memorial for him in the manner he always wanted. It will take place here in Vogler on the eve of the Kingfisher Festival. I write to ask you to do Ispin one last honor and attend. Should you come, accommodations will be available at the Brass Crab.
> 
> Though the circumstances are sad, I am eager to meet you and, through our memories, to revel in the life of our great friend.
> 
> Becklin Uth Viharin Knight of the Crown


Having grown very fond of the old adventurer Ispin, you quickly begin your journey to the port city of Kalaman, in the province of Solamnia.

I want them to think about where they are coming from and how they are getting to Kalaman. Those who wish to join the Mages of High Sorcery realise that the day they arrive is the day before the Night of the Eye, on which the Mages of High Sorcery perform their “Trial of the Barb”, a precursor to the Test of High Sorcery that will give the characters their next steps should they wish to continue on their journey.

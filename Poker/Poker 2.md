# Starting Hands
- Starting ranges vary, as you could be facing (pre flop) an unopened pot, a raised pot, and then a 3 or 4 bet pot.
- As raises come, your range shrinks and shrinks. 
- How did the person in front of you play? Did they limp, raise, or was it a 3 or 4 bet?
- It also matters what your position is (UTG, BB, SB, Button etc)
	- When UTG, up to 8 other players could have strong hands and you have no information yet.
- Stack size matters, so if you're short stacked you'll be less likely to get into a hand.
- Lastly, the strength of your cards.
- Aggressiveness of table, opponents, and table image (what do the other players think of you?).

## Types of hands
- Hands can be put into three categories (based on your position and the action):
- Premium hands
	- Strongest hands you can have
	- A-A, K-K, Q-Q, A-K
	- Generally play these with a raise from any position on the table
- Solid hands
	- Still very playable from most spots on the table
	- Often raise when first to act, but probably call raises if they come in front of you
		- Unless you have a specific read on your opponent
	- Pairs from J down to 7
	- Also A-Q, A-J suited
- Speculative hands
	- The rest of the pairs
	- Suited A (A-2h, A-10h)
	- Suited connectors (7-8h, 9-10c)
	- Only raise when in late position on the table and action has folded to you
	- Careful in early position as you're still vulnerable
	- AVOID PLAYING HANDS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SUITED
		- Suited only increases chances by 2-3%
- Suited cards go up in value when you're deep stacked
	- When you win a hand with a flush, you can win more than with top pair
- Small pairs go up in value when deep stacked
	- You lost often with small pairs, but with a deep stack you can stomach that so that you get a chance to hit a set or a full house
- Position is more important when deep stacked
	- Your decisions are for more money. Position is always an advantage so when you can win more, it's worth more
- Premium cards go DOWN in value when deep stacked
	- Most of the time when you have A-A, you win a pot with a single pair, so there isn't a lot of betting that happens to grow the pot

## The "woulda coulda" trap
- You're undecided about a hand pre-flop
- You end up folding, but the flop comes and you would have hit an insane hand
- Don't be results oriented. A good decision is based on the information that you have. 
- ALSO, if you don't fold but still hit it, that doesn't mean you should play that hand more often. Same deal

## When entering the pot
- His advice: Always come in for 3xBB into an unopened pot.
	- In low stakes games in a casino, don't do that. E.g. in a 1-3 game, don't raise to 9, go for 12 or 15 because that's what people do.
	- In tournaments, do slightly less.
- Dan Harrington says you should mix it up
	- 70% raise 30% limp
- The reason to raise is to get the riff raff out the way
	- Removes shit cards so you don't have to think about weird hands (small cards on the board)
- You can disguise the strength of your hand because you always do the same thing (helps with bluffing and with disguising strong hands)

## Types of hands
### Big pairs (A-A, K-K, Q-Q)
- Tends to win small pots and lose big ones
- You probably have the best hand pre-flop
- Goal is to be heads up against one other person going into the flop, so you should
	- Raise and push the action
	- Raise or re-raise from any position
	- If you go 50 to the flop with A-A, you are less than 50% likely to win
- Don't fold K-K pre-flop
- Should you ever limp in?
	- With Q-Q or K-K definitely no unless you're at a table with maniacs
	- With A-A, raising is a bit better, but sometimes you get someone who always raises a limper because they hate seeing people limp, so you can limp there to get some free money and disguise the hand.
- Usually just raise big pairs
	- Typically raise 3 BB
	- If someone raises before you, raise 3x the previous bet

### Medium pairs (6-6 to J-J with medium/deep stack)
- In early positions these are playable: open with a 3x raise (not when people have raised ahead of you).
	- If someone raises behind you, 50% of the time you call and 50% of the time you fold (change based on tight/loose player)
	- If it's a 4-bet, fold
- In middle position, the same thinking but you should call a raise behind you 80% of the time
- In late position, same but always call a raise. You know the information from all the people ahead of you.
	- If the original raiser is loose/wild, you can consider 3-betting
- If stacks are shallow (20-30 BB), a lot less playable.
- With medium pairs, if there's a raise ahead of you and multiple calls, you should call
	- You only have 2 outs, but your potential winnings are huge because so many more people are in the hand and your set is well-disguised
- A bad scenario is an early position raise followed by a re-raise. You should fold medium pair

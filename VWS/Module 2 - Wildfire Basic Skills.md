# Importance of Water Suppression
We want to remove one of the elements of the fire triangle. Water is a primary way to remove both heat and access to oxygen. Methods of getting water to fire are:

- Vehicles
- Aircraft
- Hydrant Systems
- Portable Pools
- Natural Sources

Water should be applied efficiently; only enough to extinguish fire. Different patters, pressures, techniques are used in different situations e.g. mop-up and active fire. This is done in part using different branches to create different types of spray.

### Jet
- Unbroken stream of water from the branch or nozzle. 
- Maximum propulsion
- Long reach, penetrating heat and flames, reaching the fire base.
- Aim at the fire's base, moving across all burning material for maximum cooling and extinguishing.
- Can also break up fuel or soil.

### Spray
- Spray nozzles break the water into small droplets.
- Increases surface area of water.
- Allows for better heat absorption.
- Useful for cooling larger areas.
- Can optimise water usage dep. on flow rate.
- Typically what will be used in most cases.

### Fog
- Very fine mist.
- Commonly used in internal structural fires.
- Useful as a heat shield but otherwise not great.
- E.g. use fog to cool a larger ash area before switching to a stronger spray.

**When using water to suppress fires, you will always consider these questions:**

- Will the water travel far enough to be effective?
- Will the stream penetrate the burning materials?
- **Will wetting unburned materials be more effective in slowing the spread of fire than using water on the burning materials?**
- **Can heat and smoke be removed from an area using the air currents created by the moving water?**
- How much water and water pressure are available to you?
- **Will steam created by suppression actions become a hazard?**

**7 Top Tips to Remember When Using Water**

1. Use an **appropriate diameter hose** and type for the job.
2. Select the **smallest branch** that will **achieve** a **result** effectively.
3. **Use water along**, rather than across, the edge of the **fireline** where possible.
4. **Direct** the **water at** what is burning **(the base)**, not the flames.
5. Use a **jet pattern for initial knock down** at the base of the flames, and then change to **spray for wider coverage.**
6. Where possible, **use additives** such as foam or a wetting agent.
7. **Shut off** the **branch** when water is no longer needed. Inform the pump operator and release pressure gently to avoid damaging the pump with water hammer.

### Enhancing Effectiveness
We can use wetting agents, retardants, and foams (Class A) to enhance effectiveness of the water. CoCTF may employ a foam system known as CAFS (Compressed Air Foam System).


# Working with Water Sources
All water sources for firefighting are classified into two categories:
1. Reticulated or Closed supplies (pumps or hydrants)
2. Static or Open supplies (dams, pools, rivers)
"Static" is used because a pump is needed to draw the water to the fire. The most common sources for which a pump is used are:
- Rivers
- Dams
- Lakes
- Swimming Pools
- Porta Pools/Onion Tanks
- Hydrants

### Porta Pools/Onion Tanks
- Portable pools or tanks that can be filled from hydrants, vehicles, or pumped into.
- Large water source.
- Designs vary.
- Add tactical options for vehicles to deploy elsewhere after filling the pool.

**Remember**
- Choose flat ground. 
- Once placed, they cannot be moved.
- Secure hose in a circular pattern at the bottom of the pool to avoid couplings from flying out due to pressure.
- Always monitor the pool level.

### Hydrants
- Attached to mains supply at regular intervals.
- Can supply water directly to a branch, but this is not advised.
- Rather use them to fill appliances e.g. pools, vehicles, and pump from there.
- Minimises pressure drop.
- Pressure varies between suburbs.

Hydrants typically have a valve and outlet with a screw-type male thread, onto which a standpipe is attached. Either underground or above. Specific equipment is needed:
- **Hydrant Standpipe**: 65 mm diameter metal pipe ~ 1 m long to connect to un

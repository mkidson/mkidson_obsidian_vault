# LACES
### L – Lookouts
Whilst all members should continuously monitor what the fire is doing as well as keep track of their fellow crew members, the Crew Leader may post a more experienced member to watch over the crew from a good vantage point to look out for crew safety and observe changes in weather conditions and fire behaviour. This role may be filled by people who are not members of the crew but have a good communication link.
### A – Awareness
Always keep aware of factors that may influence fire behaviour (topography, weather, fuels), the state of your fellow crew members and your own mental and physical state – don’t become complacent.
### C – Communication
Ensure that you always have a communication link with your fellow crew members, supervisor and other teams you are working with – either through verbal face to face communication, hand signals radio or cellphone. Make sure any information or instructions are clearly and concisely given, and that they are understood.
### E – Escape Routes
Always identify where your escape routes are, do not allow yourself to be in a position of danger by having no escape plan.
### S – Safety Zones
A safety zone is any area that is unlikely to burn - including ground already burnt over, a wetland or river, even a rock slide - where you can be certain the crew will be safe if fire conditions become hazardous. Have a safety zone in mind at all times, bearing in mind that it may change. A safety zone needs to be easily accessible via an escape route and known by all members of the crew.

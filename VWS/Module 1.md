# What is Fire
The anatomy of a flame consists of
- Fuel
- Blue flame
- Dark area
- Yellow area
- Flame shape
- Flame end


# Elements of Fire
## Heat
- Warmth or temperature
- Watching how air moves because of heat is useful 
- Speed of smoke or wavy air effect

## Smoke
- Comes from incomplete combustion
- Due to e.g. not enough oxygen


## Heat Transfer: How does fire spread
- Hot to cold areas
### Conduction
Heat moves through direct contact between materials or objects

### Convection
Heat spreads through moving fluids, like water or air

### Radiation
Heat travels as waves (IR)

## Fire Models
### The Fire Triangle
Fire is composed of Heat, Fuel, and Oxidising agent. Fire can be extinguished by removing any one of these elements:
- Water from a hose suffocates the fire of oxygen and reduces temperature
- Clearing vegetation reduces fuel load
- A blanket can remove oxygen from the environment

### The Fire Tetrahedron
This model includes the idea of a Chain Reaction being an important part of the process too. Combustion involves a chain reaction process that feeds the fire by releasing additional heat.

Tactical actions on the fireline directly relate the Fire Triangle or Tetrahedron, more specifically removing one or more elements in order to suppress the fire.

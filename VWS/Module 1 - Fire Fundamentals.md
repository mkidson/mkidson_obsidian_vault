# What is Fire
The anatomy of a flame consists of
- Fuel
- Blue flame
- Dark area
- Yellow area
- Flame shape
- Flame end


# Elements of Fire
## Heat
- Warmth or temperature
- Watching how air moves because of heat is useful 
- Speed of smoke or wavy air effect

## Smoke
- Comes from incomplete combustion
- Due to e.g. not enough oxygen


## Heat Transfer: How does fire spread
- Hot to cold areas
### Conduction
Heat moves through direct contact between materials or objects

### Convection
Heat spreads through moving fluids, like water or air

### Radiation
Heat travels as waves (IR)

## Fire Models
### The Fire Triangle
Fire is composed of Heat, Fuel, and Oxidising agent. Fire can be extinguished by removing any one of these elements:
- Water from a hose suffocates the fire of oxygen and reduces temperature
- Clearing vegetation reduces fuel load
- A blanket can remove oxygen from the environment

### The Fire Tetrahedron
This model includes the idea of a Chain Reaction being an important part of the process too. Combustion involves a chain reaction process that feeds the fire by releasing additional heat.

Tactical actions on the fireline directly relate the Fire Triangle or Tetrahedron, more specifically removing one or more elements in order to suppress the fire.

Be aware of situations where the opposite is true: two of the three pillars exist in the environment and adding the third will very quickly result in combustion. 


## Fire in Context: What is Wildland Firefighting
### Wildfire
- The focus is on suppressing fires in natural fuels: grass, shrubs, forest.
- Spread over large areas
- Require specialised tactics and equipment
- Firefighters pack lighter and wear less PPE to move quickly
- Nomex is used for fire resistance
- Contain and extinguish fires while minimising damage to natural resources

### Structural
- Rescuing people from buildings
- Extinguishing fires within structures
- Multiple layers of PPE to withstand heat
- Typically contained within buildings but can spread

### WUI (Wildland Urban Interface)
- Where vegetation and structure mixes
- Where fire can enter developed areas
- Combination of techniques
- Specialised knowledge to protect natural and man-made resources



# Wildfire Terminology
It's important to be familiar with the terminology used, for safety and communication purposes.

## Crew Terminology
### Hand Crew
- Suppression crew
- Consists of a Crew Leader, Assistant Crew Leader, and crew members
- Usually 8 people in VWS
### Skid Unit Crew
- Smaller team than hand crew
- Operating from a vehicle.
- Leader and 2 to 4 members
- Use water from skid units for suppression
- Often assigned to initial and rapid suppression of less intense fires
- Need a permanent source of water for continuous operation
### Engine Crew
- Operate from a water-carrying truck
- Used by many organisations
- Size varies from 3 to 7 members
- Always a leader, plus other standard roles for pump operation etc

## Areas of a Wildfire
![[Pasted image 20240721213944.png]]

1. **Origin:** Where the fire began
2. **Base:** Rear or heel of the fire, often near the origin, where backing fires may occur. A backing fire is when the fire is burning against the direction of the slope (downhill) or wind (downwind)
3. **Direction of Spread:** Influenced by the wind, terrain, and fuel, with wind having the greatest impact
4. **Jump Over:** When fire crosses control lines or fuel breaks, spreading into unburned areas
5. **Right Flank:** The right side of the fire, when viewed from the rear, regardless of position
6. **Left Flank:** The left side of the fire, when viewed from the rear, regardless of position
7. **Finger:** Narrow extensions of fire from the main body. They can form on the sides or at the front of the fire. On the sides, they may extend the fire temporarily or even grow into new fire fronts
8. **Pocket:** Deep indentations of unburned fuel formed by fingers or slow-burning areas. The fire's edge forms a pocket of unburned fuels surrounded by burning areas. These can pose risks to firefighters as the fire can block escape routes. Require careful approach and vigilant monitoring during suppression efforts
9. **Head:** The immediate front or leading edge of the fire
10. **Spot Fire:** Separate fires caused by burning embers carries by wind or heat columns
11. **Island:** Unburned area within or near the fire perimeter. Can become hazardous if they ignite later and are close to the main fire perimeter. Embers can then jump to unburned fuel. Islands deep within the black pose little risk. Fire managers usually let them burn out, but they require monitoring in case

## Other Wildfire Terminology
### Tactics
- **Back Burn:** Tactic used by firefighters to control fire ahead of a wildfire, typically at the fire's advancing edge. Aims to consume fuel between the fire and a control line. Often last resorts, approved by the IC due to their risk. They are very effective, when timed correctly.
- **Burn Out:** Intentional ignition of fire inside a control line to consume fire between the line and the fire's edge. Typically used on the flanks or base of a fire.
- **Firebreak:** An area cleared of vegetation down to mineral soil to prevent the spread of fire. Firebreaks aid fire management operations but may require active monitoring by firefighters.
- **Firing Operations:** Strategic or tactical use of controlled fire to manage the spread of a wildfire, including back burns, burn outs, and prescribed burns.
- **Fuel Break:** Cleared land strip reducing the rapid spread of fire by modifying or removing fuel. Regular maintenance is required.
- **Scratch Line:** An emergency control line hastily established to slow fire spread, requiring reinforcement later.
### Wildfire Behaviour
- **Blow Up:** A sudden and significant increase in a wildfire's energy, resulting in simultaneous escalation of fire spread and intensity.
- **Box Valley:** A valley enclosed by steep sides on three or all sides. Fire accelerates when burning through such valleys, akin to water speeding up in narrow streams.
- **Fire Danger Index (FDI):** A numerical rating system predicting fire risk, based on weather conditions. Currently under development for improved accuracy in the Western Cape region.
- **Fireline:** The uncontrolled edge of a wildfire.
### Geological Features and Landscape
-  **Chimney:** A narrow passage or cleft in rock or landscape.
-  **Crag:** A steep or rugged cliff or rock face.
-  **Kloof:** An Afrikaans term for a steep-sided valley, sometimes used to describe a chute or chimney depending on its size.
-  **Scree:** A collection of broken rock fragments at the base of cliffs or valley shoulders.
-  **Sloot:** An Afrikaans term for a deep gully or drainage ditch, also termed a chute in some contexts.
### Safety and Risk Management
- **Bar Scabbard:** A protective cover for a chainsaw's bar and chain, used to prevent damage and injury during transportation.
- **Hazard:** A potential source of harm or adverse health effects, existing within an environment.
- **Risk:** The chance of an adverse effect resulting from a hazard, often mitigable.
- **Trigger Point:** A predetermined condition prompting disengagement from operations to move to a safer location.
- **UXO:** A universally recognised acronym for unexploded ordinance (bullets, bombs, mines, etc.). Posing a risk near shooting ranges, military bases, or explosives manufacturing facilities.



# Types of Wildfires
## Ground Fires
- Consume ground fuels
- Burn under ground
- Along roots, etc

## Surface Fires
- Consume surface fuels 
- Burn from ground level up to two metres high

## Crown Fires
- Consume aerial fuels
- Start from ground or surface fires and go up into trees etc
- Can spread rapidly 
- Spread faster than the other two

### Types of Crown Fires
- **Passive:** These begin with individual trees or bushes burning from a surface fire. If conditions permit, this ignition spreads to nearby vegetation. Typically, this burning is short-lived and affects closely spaced trees or bushes. Passive crown fires may lead to localised spotting and demand careful monitoring for the potential spread of fire.
- **Active:** Similar to passive crown fires, active crown fires originate from surface fires. However, they involve more significant heat transfer to surrounding fuels, enabling greater progression. They may involve both aerial and surface fuels at various stages and tend to spread rapidly.
- **Independent:** Rare and not reliant on surface fires for sustenance, independent crown fires either ignite from spot fires or result from ladder fuels igniting the canopy directly. These fires continue to burn in the canopy without surface fuels below. Highly dangerous, they require more resources to extinguish than active and passive crown fires. Changes in fuel, weather, or topography are often the only means to halt independent crown fires.
![[Pasted image 20240721220004.png]]


## Spot Fires
- Occur when burning debris (firebrands) is carried by wind or heat columns away from the main fire and into unburned fuel
- Numbers of ember can vary from a few to millions
- Pose significant risk, especially in the WUI
- Embers can ignite fires deep within urban areas
- Requires embers to land on fuels that are light and dry
- Heavier fuels can be susceptible, especially with heavier ember load
### Short-range spotting
- Minimal impact on fire spread
- Typically overshadowed by the main fire
- Can signal the onset of hazardous fire behaviour
- Typically happens downwind and on the sides of the prevailing wind
### Long-range spotting
- Poses greater challenges: considerable distance from main fire
- Spreads into new vegetation but also makes a new thing to deal with
- New fires are drawn to main fire due to the inflow of air of the main heat column
- Column pulls in cooler air from surroundings
- Significant danger for firefighters to become trapped


# The Fire Behaviour Triangle

![[Pasted image 20240721221159.png]]

# Behaviour due to Weather
Weather is the primary influence on wildfire behaviour. Its constant changing means it's the most important of the 3. Weather conditions on the day of ***and*** the days leading up to, the fire, significantly impact behaviour.

## Temperature
- Air temp influences ignition and combustion
- Solar radiation heats the earth and promotes drying of fuel to make ignition easier
- Slope and aspect determines sun exposure
- North- and west-facing slopes receive more sun
- Lower nighttime temps typically make fires easier to suppress, but daytime conditions vary
- Fuel temp affects fire spread
- High temp reduces humidity, drying out vegetation

## Wind
- Temperature variations cause wind
- Named for where it comes from
- Day and night affects wind (temperature)
- Increases fire intensity, especially when fanning due to temperature-driven air movement
- Dries fuel, supplies oxygen
- Embers can be thrown around, heating the ground and aiding in drying fuel

### Wind Types
- **Prevailing Wind:** Wind generally seen in an area, seasonally etc. Not necessarily present
- **General Wind:** The main wind reported in forecasts etc. Can add oxygen and influence general direction of fire spread
- **Local Wind:** Results from natural features on a smaller scale. Can lead to valley and slope winds, which affect fire behaviour. Localised fire spread.
- **Surface Wind:** Measured 6-10 m above the ground. Affect fire behaviour through ember spread etc. Can drive crown fires
- **Mid-flame Wind:** Occur halfway up the flames and have the greatest impact on the immediate direction of fire spread
- **Fire Whirls:** Can move completely out of the main area. Ignite fuels at their base as they move. Generally a bad time

## Relative Humidity
- Measures moisture in the atmosphere: Ratio of actual water vapor in the air to the amount needed for saturation *at a given temperature*
- Lower RH dries vegetation and increases fire risk
- RH fluctuates throughout the day
- Warmer air can hold more moisture


## Atmospheric Stability
- **Unstable Atmosphere:** Encourages vertical air movement, increasing fire activity.
- **Stable Atmosphere**: Discourages vertical air movement, leading to slower fire spread.
- **Inversion:** The most stable atmospheric condition, especially near the surface. Inversions can quickly break and lead to rapid escalation of the fire.

![[Pasted image 20240721223114.png]]

# Behaviour due to Fuels
Fuel is any material available to ignite and burn, usually vegetation. State of the fuel affects behaviour, i.e. brown vegetation is drier than green so burns better.

Fynbos and eucalypts have oils so while they appear green can burn even more aggressively.

## Types of Fuels
### Heavy Fuels
- Slower burning
- Thick logs or tree trunks
- More heat to ignite but also more effort to extinguish
- Burn slower and longer

### Light Fuels
- Faster-burning fuels
- Grasses, twigs, needles
- Referred to as tinder
- Less effort to extinguish
- Less residual heat

### Ground (underground) Fuels
- Situated in deep layers of leaves, roots, logs, peat
- Tend to burn for long at low intensity 
- Tend to smoulder for very long
- Nicknamed "zombie fires"

### Surface Fuels
- Located from ground to approximately two metres high
- Tall grass, shrubs, forest debris
- When beneath trees, lead to spread of fires to higher levels through ladder fuels

### Ladder Fuels
- Continuous arrangement of combustible materials enabling fires to move upward into aerial fuels in the canopy
- Tall grasses, bushes, slash, sizeable shrubs, tree bark, fallen dead branches

### Aerial Fuels
- In the overhead canopy
- > 2 metres above ground
- Fires can spread through aerial fuels alone
- Very dangerous
- Crown fires

## Properties of Fuels
### Size and Shape
- Finer fuels ignite quicker, leading to faster spread
- Small fuels release moisture quickly and require lower temperatures to ignite

### Size and Shape of Embers
- Affects fire spread and spotting
- Small embers lose heat rapidly and typically cause spot fires only near to the main fire
- Large embers retain heat and can cause long-range spotting

### Chemical Content
- Oils in plants can lead to being more flammable, and more fiercely burning
- Fynbos, Renosterveld, Eucalyptus, Pines

### Moisture Content
- More water means burns less


## Environmental factors influencing moisture content
### Indirect Influences
- Time of Day
- Cloud Cover
- Fuel Canopy
- Aspect
- Slope
- Elevation
- Shade Cover

### Direct Influences
- Wind
- Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Precipitation

> [!NOTE] **_As a firefighter sizing up a wildfire you must always ask “how will these fuels burn”?_**

## Arrangement of Fuels
### Compact Fuels
- Very little space between them
- Present less surface area for combustion
- Spread more slowly than loose packs

### Loaded (Area) Fuels
- Fuel loading refers to the total dry weight of fuel accumulated in a specific area
- More highly loaded areas will result in higher intensity fire

### Horizontal Continuity
- Arrangement of fuels next to each other across a surface
- Affects rate of spread
- Scattered fuels mean less chance of spread than continuously arranged fuels

### Vertical Continuity
- Arrangement stacked on top of each other, including surface and aerial fuels
- Ladder fuels result in high vertical continuity
- Also greatly affect spread



# Behaviour due to Topography
Topography is the shape of the land, including elevation changes and locations of natural and human-made structures. Greatly affect rate of speed (ROS) and presence of fuels. Generally considered "static" for a given situation as it doesn't change much.

## Features
### Valleys or Kloofs
- Always a similar effect, but depends on steepness, width, size
- Narrow valleys run perpendicular to ridges of mountains. Prone to fire spreading across the valley through spotting or radiant heat. Narrow valleys will accelerate uphill ROS
- Wide valleys have less chance of fire spread across the valley due to spotting etc, except in high winds and specific fuels. More susceptible to prevailing winds and swirling effects of wind over ridge lines.
- Box valleys are steep sided valleys surrounded on all or three sides. Fire tends to be drawn along and upward due to winds channelled up and over ridge lines. Fire can burn in a circular fashion, leading to dangerous situations.

### Chimneys or Chutes
- Narrow topographic features
- Fire behaves similarly to in narrow valleys but more extreme
- ROS is accelerated upslope
- Extremely hazardous and to be avoided
- Trench Effect occurs (accelerated spread up the trench)

### Ridges 
- Long high area that slopes down to two different aspects on each side
- Dominant ridges form a prominent skyline feature with one or more spur ridges connected
- Spur ridges are small and finger-like off of a main ridge
- Flat ridges are gently sloping ridges. Make good places for fire containment as they're easy to travel along and have moderate fire behaviour
- Knife ridges have steep slopes on either side of a sharp ridge
- Depending on the characteristics and fuel present, ridges can be selected for control lines, or even Direct Attacks
- Ridges can slow fires as they encounter upslope airflow from the opposing side
- Essential to assess current conditions
- Erratic winds can cause quick changes in fire beaviour

### Saddles
- Sloping gap or depression on a ridgeline
- Same effect on air movement as a chimney or narrow valley
- Wind increases speed and strength as it moves through the constricted area
- Typically accelerates fire spread and intensity
- Can cause shifts in direction

### Natural or Constructed Barriers
- Key to planning methods of attack and containment lines
- Rivers, lakes, rocky areas, previously burned areas, young fynbos (1-2 years), large cliff faces with no vegetation
- Firebreaks, fuel breaks, control lines, roads, reservoirs, dams, parking areas, loading zones etc
- Slow down surface fire spread, but may not be effective in high winds
- Crucial to consider predicted flame length, esp for safety zones



## Characteristics
### Slope
- Measured as the percentage change in elevation over a specific distance
- Use contour lines
- Influences type and density of vegetation
- Steep slopes lead to fast fire spread uphill due to preheating of fuels
- ROS up a slope is exponential, with speed doubling for every 20% or $10^\degree$ of slope increase
	- 0 – 20% results in a determined flame height and a rate of spread.
	- 20 – 40% results in an increase of 2 x flame height and 4 x rate of spread.
	- 40 – 60% results in 2.5 x flame height and 8 x rate of spread.
	- 60 – 80% results in 3 x flame height and 14 x rate of spread.
![[Pasted image 20240723222325.png]]

> Note: When communicating a position on a slope to others you may use the terms, lower, middle, and upper to describe the location.

- Need to consider potential for burning material to roll downhill, below the control line, and ignite new fire
- Advised to position control line activities at the top or base of a slope
- Working mid-slope is hazardous and requires thorough assessment beforehand

### Aspect
- Refers to the cardinal direction it faces
- Determines amount of sunlight it receives
- North and northwest slopes are more susceptible (in SA) due to the lighter and sparser fuels, higher temperatures, lower humidity, and lower moisture
- South and southeast slopes have heavier fuels, so can also be risks for fire spread but of a different kind\



# Fire Danger Index
- Informs on daily fire weather conditions and their impact on wildfires
- Blue is lowest risk to Red is highest risk
- Assesses risk based on temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and recent rainfall

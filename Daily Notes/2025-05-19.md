# NASA HAB meeting points to hit
- We are the n-lab at UCT
- We're part of the metrology research group here, focusing on radiation, in particular neutrons
- Neutrons are created in interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere and make up almost half the dose received at airplane altitudes
- The impact of energetic space weather events on neutron dose is not known, so we want to make measurements of that
- We're creating a detector that outputs a pulse to the MAXIQ board whenever an event is detected. The board will count those pulses in a given time window

## From Tanya
- Who we are (n-lab, UCT) 
- Quick 30s on Cosmic on air
- Show the safecast, it does gammas
	- We've mounted it onto a board that will interface with MAXIQ
- Then show the new neutron + all one
	- Get from Clint
	- Mention that it's my PhD
- If asked about sending one to Parklands, we still need to have a talk about it, but we can make something and send to them if necessary
- Progress
	- Safecast
	- SiPM
		- The three boards exist and I've tested them
		- We are trying to wrap our heads around the acquisition
		- But Parklands is involved and it's more useful and efficient for them to do it
- Timelines


# In-meeting notes
- NASA Goddard High Altitude Balloon
	- From Port Sumner in New Mexico
	- 15 Aug +/- 2 weeks
- MAXIQ Provides
	- Power from NASA
	- GPS data
	- Launch
	- Payload return
- Lots of people doing Xchips stuff
	- Cameras and GPSs seem to be the most interesting
	- Someone wants to use a microphone, could be complicated
### Deadlines

- Payloads shipped by end of June
- Apparently we have access to Judi's calendar to schedule meetings

### Next steps
- Decide on Xchips to use
- Start coding


# CoA Meeting Francois
- Lots of working coming
- Want a detector in the next few months that can fly
- AirFrance are interested
	- Detectors ready for 2028

# NASA HAB meeting points to hit
- We are the n-lab at UCT
- We're part of the metrology research group here, focusing on radiation, in particular neutrons
- Neutrons are created in interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere and make up almost half the dose received at airplane altitudes
- The impact of energetic space weather events on neutron dose is not known, so we want to make measurements of that
- We're creating a detector that outputs a pulse to the MAXIQ board whenever an event is detected. The board will count those pulses in a given time window

## From Tanya
- Who we are (n-lab, UCT) 
- Quick 30s on Cosmic on air
- Show the safecast, it does gammas
	- We've mounted it onto a board that will interface with MAXIQ
- Then show the new neutron + all one
	- Get from Clint
	- Mention that it's my PhD
- If asked about sending one to Parklands, we still need to have a talk about it, but we can make something and send to them if necessary
- Progress
	- Safecast
	- SiPM

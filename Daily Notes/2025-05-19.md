# NASA HAB meeting points to hit
- We are the n-lab at UCT
- We're part of the metrology research group here, focusing on radiation, in particular neutrons
- Neutrons are created in interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere and make up almost half the dose received at airplane altitudes
- The impact of energetic space weather events on neutron dose is not known, so we want to make measurements of that
- We're creating a detector that outputs a pulse to the MAXIQ board whenever an event is detected. The board will count those pulses in a given time window

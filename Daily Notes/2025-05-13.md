- Test with a little bit of lead on a detector to look at the way it removes x-rays (< 100 keV). Try with Cs (~30 keV) 
- The Capitec measures activity
	- Bad at measuring low activity, so we stack sources and get the difference between activity
	- Could also use NaI to measure activity
	- AND to measure efficiency at 511 keV from Na-22

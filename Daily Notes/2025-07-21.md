# Meeting agenda
## General Admin
- Registration for PhD is being weird

## Feedback from ASNR Trompier
- Funding?
- Francois says on track
- But until when? Maybe September

## October no more Cadarache :(
- I haven't booked the flights yet
- Would love to go to Paris
- Maybe Easter 2026
- I will deliver, with Andy, the n-gamma counter to Francois
- 

## iThemba LABS September
- Needs a plan
- Which detectors etc
- Formalise into a document what will be there
	- One cylinder will get a lead hat and we'll extrapolate

## n-gamma counter to Francois in October 
- Needs the PSD circuit from Tom
- I could deliver it
- Needs Tom's PSD circuit, which I need to bug him about
- Will go to an ADC which talks to the M5 stack
	- How does uncertainty work on that?
	- This is priority number 1
	- Save Qs Ql time
	- And then display counts per time period (5s) on the display
	- Make component hit list
	- 

## Simulate lead cap as a neutron multiplier
- Cylinder 
- With slices of lead in the front, with different energies of neutrons
- What order of magnitude increase in neutron detection do we get

## Other cosmic-on-air stuff..
- I need to lead things??


## CCRI 
- There will be a key comparison study with iThemba and RNCP (Japan) 
	- 2 energies, everyone brings reference detectors
	- Our spectrometer needs to be a reference detector by then

## DAQ
- Tanya's RPi board will be extended to 4 channels
- Will need to be tested
- Middle-ground, but not the end point
- We need to make something that can be a counter but with PSD
- I need to get on the RedPitaya
	- With the PSI intern (Michael's son)
	- Tanya will link us
- Tanya is looking at redoing QtDAQ/wavedump
- I want to test the stability of the USB vs the optical input for QtDAQ


## Gamma-gamma
- Being pulled into the third year project
- Measure activity of the sources
- Then efficiency of safecast, small sphere, etc

## MAXIQ ISS mission
- New board might need some work

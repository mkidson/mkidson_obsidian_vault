Chapter 3
More 14 MeV (in angular section)
Do PSD plots and then lineshapes, then the multiple angles
photos in position


Chapter 5
Check the AMANDE calibration to see if it can be muddled to fit with the good calibrations





Chapter 1
Introduce the figures more
include plots from accelerator and reactor facilities

This is where we get neutrons 
This is what they do to humans and electronics
This is why we need spectrometers (challenges of measuring)

ToF is the gold standard but it needs ns pulsed beams, which don't exist in the field

Mention that Bonner spheres are unfolding
Mention activation
Solid state detectors (unfolding)

Introduce the "WHY"

Remove the focus on aircraft and make it more general workplace environments

1.1
What do I need to take from previous work? Can be less specific about dimensions etc

1.2
Cylinder size is typical for 20 MeV so that's why we chose it. That could be in chapter 3 though

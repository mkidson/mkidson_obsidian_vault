# Meeting with Francois and Sebastien Celestin
- We want to combine the XStorm and our detectors to use the same digitiser
- Shown him the DRS evaluation board thing
- They use time accurate to ~100 ns with GPS
## XStorm
- Gets signal from BGO and EJ-276 at 40 MHz and 200 MHz, into an FPGA that gets the waveform and integral
- Also the GPS PPS data
- See "Microbursts" which is probably protons depositing in the BGO, which makes the electronics do some weird stuff because the pulses are large

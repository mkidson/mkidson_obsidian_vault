# Andy Tanya meeting
- Chat to Bongi about the accom repayment to send a form to Andy to sign
- Plot different options on same plot
- Energy peak is not a gaussian
	- How to get the peak energy
	- Trial and error the distance to get the peak to line up
- Slopiness on peak
	- From time bins to energy bins
	- Make a time spectrum for neutrons to be used in the standard rebinning software, send to Kutullo
- How does the CFD affect the slopiness of the energy and T spectrum
- Look at L-T and L-E plots
- Show the difference between using CFD on both, vs CFD on one, vs no CFD for the ToF
- Plot the different particle types from EXPACS
- Compare with CARI7A

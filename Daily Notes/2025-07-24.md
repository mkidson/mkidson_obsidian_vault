## Spherical scintillator patent
- Pg 3. Line 17: "neutron and/or gamma ray detection" makes it seem like you can do neutron without gamma ray. It's a very slight point
- Pg 3. Summary of the invention: This is covering many bases. Effectively any scintillation-based detector that takes a spherical shape. Is that reasonable to claim?
- Pg 9. Line 19: It's not really a truncated cone, as there is a dip in the top. Maybe more like a volcano? "Truncated cone with a spherical concave top"
- Pg 9. Line 32: Not necessarily done with mono-energetic neutrons.
- Pg 12. Line 7: 14.1 MeV neutrons
- Pg 13. "Results": It's not mentioned that this sphere has a flat spot on it.
- I feel strange about comparing the cylinder to the sphere as the wrapping was fundamentally different. I think a cylinder wrapped with PTFE tape on the sides with a reflector on top will make a different spectrum

## Spherical scintillator patent
- Pg 3. Line 17: "neutron and/or gamma ray detection" makes it seem like you can do neutron without gamma ray. It's a very slight point
- Pg 3. Summary of the invention: This is covering many bases. Effectively any scintillation-based detector that takes a spherical shape. Is that reasonable to claim?
- Pg 9. Line 19: It's not reawhat islly a truncated cone, as there is a dip in the top. Maybe more like a volcano?

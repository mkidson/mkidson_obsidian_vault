# Catchup
- Spreading of E at high L is called "slew" maybe. We will need to look at the T spectrum as it's linear there and quadratic in E.
- Maybe look at the low L region to see if the peak is sharper/shifted left
- Angus may have something about the CFD point or the start point to the integral, but maybe not.
- Leave summed pulse alone (for ToF) for now
- The balloon data comparison should start with neutrons and photons, and maybe protons.

# NASA HAB presentation
1. Opening slide, NASA, MAXIQ, authors (Clint), collaborations, Salter base etc
2. Detector basics. Built at UCT, custom power and signal processing boards.
3. Andy's slide from Paris presentation showing the raw data, effectively
4. Then zooming into the nice data. Explain EXPACS and CARI7a (no breakdown, just the final dose rate). Get vertical lines showing the different atmospheric layers here. Simulation was done without considering drift -- that's something to work on next. Put temperature on the top x-axis. 
5. Freezer plots showing temperature dependence, something we haven't corrected for yet but will do.
6. Something about the particle type breakdown

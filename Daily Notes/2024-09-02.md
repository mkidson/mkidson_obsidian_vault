For Tanya ANP Late September
- 2 SiPM 120 mm detector
- Demonstrate the next gen of Erin detector (1 SiPM 120 mm)
- 1 vs 2 means geometric mean vs choose the SiPM at 0 degrees
- [x] 1 vs 2 SiPM monoenergetic (14.1 MeV) @ 0 degrees
	- [ ] L
	- [ ] L-S
	- [ ] S (Figure of Merit)
	- [ ] Basically just provide the L-S matrix with 512x512 bins
- [x] 2 SiPM monoenergetic (all energies)
	- [x] L-S
- [x] 2 SiPM monoenergetic (14.1 & 2.5 MeV) @ 0, 90 degrees
	- [x] L-S
- [ ] 2 SiPM broad beam
	- [x] L-S
	- [x] L-E
	- [x] neutron responses
	- [ ] Maaaaaybe L vs E if the fitting isn't a bitch
- [ ] AmBe L for unfolding
- [x] Simulation of L for the AMANDE energies (14.1, 5, 2.5) (tell Tanya the number of primaries)
- [ ] Simulate at 50(?) MeV

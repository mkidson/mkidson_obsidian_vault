# NASA HAB presentation
1. Hello everyone. I will be presenting the data from our experiment on board the high altitude balloon, which measured cosmic radiation using a compact detector. Thank you to MAXIQ and NASA for this opportunity.
2. Cosmic radiation comes in many forms, including neutrons, protons, and gamma rays. When this radiation is incident on a piece of scintillator material, it deposits its energy which produces flashes of light. The light bounces around the scintillator material until it hits a photodetector, which in our case is a silicon photomultiplier.

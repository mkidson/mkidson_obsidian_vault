# Sphere paper outline
## Which way does it go?
- No real novelty in doing a characterisation of EJ-276
- How do we do this one so it isn't just characterisation?
- Less about the material and more about the shape
- Needs to be a comparison, showing explicitly why the geometry is better in certain scenarios
- Prism works well as it presents it in good faith, compared to cylinder on SiPM
- Cylinder on array is good, but increases complexity
- Has someone compared 4 sipm cylinder to 1 sipm?


## Sections
We're using scintillator from the same era and preferably one SiPM that we switch between all the detectors.
Scintillators have equal lengths, to compare with the standard cylinder.

### PSD and edge resolution and directionality 
- Using cylinder on 1 SiPM, prism on 1 SiPM, sphere on 1 SiPM, and cylinder on 4 SiPM
	- STNG
	- AmBe
	- Gamma sources
- Makes the case for the sphere
- FoM
- Edge resolution
	- Collimate Cs
	- Flood the detector with STNG
- PSD
	- AmBe flood as not interested in edge resolution
	- 
### Characterisation of the sphere
- Responses functions (PTB)
	- L vs E (Birks)
	- Efficiency (?)
- Unfolding
	- Monoenergetic from AMANDE
	- AmBe from nlab

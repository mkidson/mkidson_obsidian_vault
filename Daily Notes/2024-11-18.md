- Small details that don't help the story
- Don't worry too much about copying e.g. the n-lab paper
- Be consistent with referring to elements
- Take new n-lab picture
- Don't start sentences with symbols or acronyms
- Don't be nitpicky about your own work
- Redo the EJ-276 output spectrum and say "adapted from [ref]"
- Remake the quenching cycle
- More detail on reflectivity of surfaces and boundary interactions e.g. Snell's law
- Save future work issues for that section
- Floating figures not referenced in the text
- Footnotes for negative comments maybe
- Digitiser/acquisition process after design
- Change Pulse Integral axes to be mV ns units
- Check the Cs measurements upstairs and downstairs and if they're in the same position, use the nice one for all of them
- "we consider it acceptable when there isn't another option" for the 1 point calibration
- figure of CFD
- For the FoM optimisation, put an AmBe L-S spectrum with good and bad gate lengths
- Then show FoM plot for AmBe
- Then say how we optimised, not mentioning that it's done with AMANDE data
- Neutron cut should go down to the point that you're sure is separated, and then cut it all off below that
- Defining the Digital Light Output Parameter - Buffler Hutton
- Difference in L is not the SiPM thing necessarily, it's because of the long gate abruptly cutting off the pulse

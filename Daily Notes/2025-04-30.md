# For Friday meeting
## I have been doing:
- Experimenting with the FPGA board to try get that working
	- I think I can do the read in of the ADC, but struggling to get the SD card working
	- Clint may have some old code that I can look through to try get it right
- Testing the power supply. 
	- Saw some kind of small drift to lower gain
	- Need to check out the long run (try do this before the meeting)
	- And the before and after weekend 
- Investigating using WaveDump for the CAEN boxes
- Want to look at using NRESP in Geant4
	- And validating the scintillation package
-

# Progress Report
## n-gamma counter
- Electronics
	- I'm working on the PSD circuit/filter
	- Unsure about the state of the SiPM and power supply boards
- I've not yet looked at coding on the M5Stack properly
- I looked at the FoM on my detector from goo and PTFE tape and compared it to glue and paint, and the FoM is sliiiiightly lower but it hasn't degraded considerably
	- paint: 1.4230 (84)
	- tape: 1.4570 (70)


## Simulation
### Photon timing
- My first attempt showed that as the flat spot radius increases, while keeping the same SiPM size, the photons arrive at the sensor closer together in time
### Light collection
- When we look at how many photons reach the sensor as a function of flat spot radius, we find that a circle inscribed on the inside of the square of the SiPM detects the most photons

Conclusion here? I think you clearly get better timing resolution (thus better PSD) from a bigger flat spot radius, but if you go any bigger than half the side length of the SiPM, you start to degrade your light output resolution. When we consider that we actually don't mind missing a few events that much, then maybe bigger is better. At which point do we just say go as big as possible and go to a hemisphere? Hard to say

## Efficiency
- I've taken the data but not analysed yet, for radiacode, GMC, and n-lab detector

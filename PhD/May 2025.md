# Balloon flight
## Pancake + SafeCast
- [ ] Clint compiling the components
- [ ] Sends a logic pulse to the MAXIQ board
	- [ ] Parklands High working on the DAQ
	- [ ] Bjarke to do it in parallel and we use that
		- [ ] I can also have a look, Clint has put code on the boards, can help me learn it

## SiPM + Scintillator
### Power supply board
- [ ] Andy's Temu board
	- [ ] I need to understand the voltage drift more
		- [ ] Check what the timescale is
		- [ ] Check if it's a voltage drift affecting the SiPM gain
		- [ ] Check SiPM with the normal PSU to see if there's any drift
- [ ] Clint is making a board for the same purpose
- [ ] Do we have other off-the-shelf options?

### SiPM board
- [ ] Clint is making a board for this detector with one SiPM on it
	- [ ] He's trying to solder it himself, but if that doesn't work it goes to the usual place
	- [ ] I need to test it to see if it works as expected
- [ ] Scintillator
	- [ ] Attached using resin
		- [ ] Tanya and I to test resin on scintillator and glass
	- [ ] What size/shape is the scintillator?
		- [ ] How tall can we make it?
			- [ ] Total detector height is 28 mm (from 1 mm below the PCB)
			- [ ] Where does the scintillator start above the PCB (define a global coordinate system?)
		- [ ] Cuboid
			- [ ] 6x6x6?
			- [ ] Bigger in the detector plane dimensions with overlap?
		- [ ] Spherical
			- [ ] Needs a ~9 mm diameter flat spot for the 6 mm SiPM
			- [ ] Radius depends on height restriction, accounting for the bit missing due to the flat spot
			- [ ] Spherical is nice for marketing, but I don't think will change much about the measurement
			- [ ] 
- [ ] SiPM
	- [ ] 6 mm?
	- [ ] Another one e.g. the Hamamatsu ones I have
- [ ] SiPM + Scintillator encased in something
	- [ ] Made by James?
	- [ ] 3D printed?
	- [ ] Wrapping
		- [ ] White silicone
			- [ ] Does it react with the plastic in any way
			- [ ] What's the light collection like? (Not too important to make it as good as possible, so long as it's reasonable as this is a counter)
		- [ ] Wrapping the scintillator in PTFE tape before the silicone?
	- [ ]

# Red Pitaya

- [ ] Get sample rate, bit resolution, voltage range etc
- [ ] Then get the best waveform I can find for the CAEN box for AmBe and for Cs (I think with the sphere, just check with Tanya)
- [ ] Downsample the measured data in both time and voltage to match the Pitaya, and see how that affects edge resolution and FoM
- [ ] Try make the code general so that we can use it for any system 
## Specs
- Two 125 Msps 14-bit inputs
- 1 MOhm / 10 pF input impedance
- Ranges of +/- 1 V and +/- 20 V

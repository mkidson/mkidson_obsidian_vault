# Fundamentals
## Be the house
Make sure that you are the one in any hand that has the edge. Even with a small edge, you will lose sometimes but overall you will come up good.

## Hand rankings
- Royal flush
- Straight flush
- 4 of a kind
- Full house
- Flush
- Straight
- 3 of a kind
- 2 pair
- 1 pair
- High card

## When looking at the community cards, work out what is the best possible hand with those cards?

## Types of straight draws
- Double belly buster
	- When two different cards can give you a straight (e.g. 76 flopping 593)
	- Is well disguised if you hit it, meaning even if a 4 comes it's not obvious that you have the straight. 
- Open ended draw
	- 10J and flopping 9Q2. 
	- The board looks quite "straight"-y, so people can read it better.

## Useful facts
- You cannot make a full house without a pair on the board.
- You cannot make a flush without 3 of a suit on the board.
	- Beware the "idiot" end of a straight, as in 23 flopping 456.
- Straights can be tricky to identify, and few unpaired boards *can't* have a straight.
- You can't have a straight without a 5 or a 10.
- Bottom two pair is a vulnerable hand. If a higher card pairs on the board, you are counterfeited.
- Full house is the best hand if you have the third of the highest pair on the board. (Q3 - QQ882)

## Setup
- One player is the dealer, or the "button".
- The left of the dealer is the small blind.
- Left of them is the big blind.
- Left of them is Under the Gun (UTG) and has to act first.
- Minimum bet is the BB.
- Minimum raise is the amount of the previous bet or raise (you can't just bet $1 when the big blind is $5).
	- Subtly here, the UTG can call the BB, or they can bet twice the big blind or anything above that.
- The blind straddle is only in cash games and it raises the stakes.
	- UTG can straddle by putting in double the BB.
	- The Mississippi straddle is when anyone can do it, but dealer gets priority. And it's 2-5 times the BB

## Stacks
- Each player has a certain number of chips on the table.
- You can only bet your stack.
- If you go all in with someone else who has more than you, there's a side pot. You may only ever win your stack from other people.
- Side pot:
	- Player A has 1500, B has 800, C has 2300.
	- B wins, A second best, C third best.
	- B wins 2400 (their 800 stack plus 800 from each of the others)
	- A gets the "side pot", which is the amount that A bet over B's stack (700) plus that amount from C, so 1400 total.
	- C loses 800 to B, 700 to C, and gets the rest back.
- Sometimes you can refer to your stack as the number of big blinds.

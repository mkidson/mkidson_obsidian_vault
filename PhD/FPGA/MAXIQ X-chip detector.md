- Light sensor
	- onsemi SiPM?
	- Hamamatsu SiPM?
	- Other type of photodiode? 
	- Price of the SiPM greatly affects MAXIQ prices
- Power supply
	- MAXIQ boards run at 3.3 V
	- Needs to be stepped up to 28.5 (depends on SiPM used)
- Scintillator
	- PSD not necessary
	- EJ-200
	- EJ-299 so it's sensitive to neutrons
	- 6mm x 6mm or a different shape/size
- Pulse processing
	- Threshold trigger for a logic pulse

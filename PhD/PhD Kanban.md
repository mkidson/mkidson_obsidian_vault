## To-do

- [ ] Add a lead cap to a detector and check how that affects the x-ray (<100 keV) distribution changes. Use Cs if possible, on probs the sphere for low threshold.
- [ ] Play with CAPINTEC. Andy sent the manual and Mike's activity measurements
- [ ] Test new SiPM boards in a consistent manner (and come up with the testing method)

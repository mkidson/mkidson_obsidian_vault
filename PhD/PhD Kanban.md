## To-do

- [ ] Play with CAPINTEC. Andy sent the manual and Mike's activity measurements
- [ ] Test new SiPM boards in a consistent manner (and come up with the testing method)
- [ ] Research off-the-shelf DAQ systems with stats that we need
- [ ] Downsampling: Make it just choose every 4 samples or whatever. But make sure it randomly chooses which sample to start on
- [ ] Efficiency measurements using coincidence. NaI first
- [ ] Patent application last 3 pages (the claim)


## In Progress

- [ ] Test red detector with glue after flight


## Complete

- [ ] Test red detector with glue before flight
- [ ] Play with MAXIQ board to learn about flashing, and get something working for the acquisition of the balloon detector(s)
- [ ] Continue the downsampling tests, check with Tanya what might be going wrong
- [ ] Implement interrupts on the MAXIQ board
- [ ] Add a lead cap to a detector and check how that affects the x-ray (<100 keV) distribution changes. Use Cs if possible, on probs the sphere for low threshold.
- [ ] Check if the attenuation makes sense given the thickness of the lead hat and the energies of the gamma rays
- [ ] Write something to an SD card and read it on the laptop
- [ ] Ask jill for PHYLAB3 access

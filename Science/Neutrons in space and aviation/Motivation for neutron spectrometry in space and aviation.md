- Astronauts in long term missions by far exceed the annual dose limits applied for radiation workers on earth and the exposure to space radiation remains one of the major health concerns for astronauts (Chancellor et al., 2014)
- Solar flares produce additional neutrons with energies ranging from thermal up to several GeV (Armstrong et al., 2001).
- Measurements inside the ISS have mostly been carried out for the charged particle component, resulting in dose equivalent values around 500 µSv/day depending on the location inside the ISS (Smith et al., 2013).
- For example, measurements with Bonner spheres equipped with activation foil detectors made near solar maximum in low inclination with high altitude resulted in a dose equivalents ranging from 45 µSv/day to 345 µSv/day depending on the orbit inclination and altitude (Wilson et al., 2002)
- The future settlements on the Moon will provide additional GCR shielding since they will be buried beneath layers of lunar regolith. However, this will decrease the dose rate from charged particles, but the shielding from in situ resources will increase the absolute contribution from neutrons, which was previously described in the Apollo 17 Lunar Neutron Probe Experiment (Woolum et al., 1975
- Dosimetry of aircrew is routinely achieved using numerical approaches validated by measurements made on board aircraft. However, in cases of randomly occurring solar eruptive phenomena, which can produce a burst of sufficiently energetic Solar Particle Events to be classified as a Ground Level Event (GLE), the dose rates at flight altitudes can be significantly increased. Current dosimetry models for GLEs cannot be easily validated due to the very few on-board measurements during such phenomena

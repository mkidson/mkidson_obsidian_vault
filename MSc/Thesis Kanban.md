## To-do

- [ ] Unfolding
- [ ] Try reassign events in S histograms by fitting
- [ ] Loot at seconds from first event for the weird locus at low S
- [ ] Find studies on SiPM nonlinearity
- [ ] PSD cut automations? Something to do with the standard deviation etc.
- [ ] All 4 AMANDE energies simulate energy dep for sphere. Fully irradiated. With and without a broadening factor. Plotted with AMANDE data
- [ ] Example pulse of equal energy from all different detector shapes and PMs. Would be cool to show at some point.
- [ ] SiPMs in radiation environments. Look at research
- [ ] Change cfd to only look at a certain window. If we know the post trigger amount and acquisition window length, then we can choose a region where the trigger from the digitiser would be
- [ ] Redo the CFD optimisation that Angus does in his thesis. pg 36.
- [ ] Check the fraction of escaping recoils in cylinder compared to sphere
- [ ] Thesis structure and a plan for realising it
- [ ] Make final plots of things where possible

Neutrons as secondary radiation are present in a number of environments where their interaction with biological matter as well as electronics can lead to adverse health and technological effects. These environments include on-board aircraft at typical cruising altitudes (10-20 km above sea level), in spacecraft, in proton therapy centres, and in nuclear research or power facilities.

The energy spectrum of neutrons in aircraft has been shown to range from the thermal region to upwards of GeV, but peaks at both 1 MeV and 100 MeV (Goldhagen et al., 2004). A similar distribution was shown to be present in proton therapy centres (De Saint-Hubert et al., 2016). The energy spectrum present in low earth orbit is not well-documented

- Response functions all normalised to unit integral (INTEGRAL)
- Scale the responses up or down to fit the liquid ones on the L range
- Work out what a 0.5 MeVee threshold is in the new L scale
- Calculate efficiency curve for the liquid, with this new threshold
- Hopefully it should match the one for EJ-276 in shape, but maybe not magnitude. If not, play with the L scaling
- Scale EJ-301 down or up to match EJ-276 and save that scaling factor
- Determine the lowest L threshold that could be reasonably applied to the sphere responses, making sure the whole edge is visible (might be able to take some liberties here)
- Scale that L threshold to EJ-301, repeat above steps, and scale down or up using the magnitude scaling factor.
- Voila you have an efficiency curve for EJ-276 with a really low threshold

Clearly an artefact of the interpolation I’m doing.

At low energy deposition (that is, when there is a single proton that deposits a small amount of energy in the midst of an interaction involving many particles, be that due to it being an escape or a low energy (n,p) scatter), the E to L conversion needs to have a reasonable guess as to what to call the light output for those low energy protons.

If it chooses a constant value, then we see these enhancements at intervals equal to that value. I tried letting the data go all the way to (0,0) but it didn’t seem to help it perfectly. The main issue is in the Compton continuum, we see a few bumps and divots where it should be mostly flat.

Maybe try increasing statistics to see if they persist.

Another option is to use the exponential function to fill in the gaps at low energy, but I don’t think those models are particularly well-motivated at low E. It would provide a smooth descent to 0 that isn’t just linear, which could be useful.

Lots to consider. Ignoring it for now while I get the cylinder simulation looking right

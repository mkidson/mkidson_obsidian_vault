I get the feeling that I can’t calculate an uncertainty on the calibration time and then propagate that through. I need to decide the upper and lower bounds of the calibration time, then use those times to do all the same analysis and end up with an upper and lower bound on the energy for a given L edge.

Then I’m also not sure if I should treat that like a type B uncertainty with a/sqrt(3) or whatever it is.

I’m going to be assuming that the E vs L response is approximately linear over short distances and thus we can use the difference in L position for a given energy from all three datasets and assume the difference in E will be the same.

For now, I’m just using the bounds on E as the uncertainty. That might change

My goodness the change is small

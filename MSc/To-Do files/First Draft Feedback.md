- [ ] Photo of n-lab
- [ ] Photo of sphere wrapped
- [ ] Photo of deconstructed and constructed
- [ ] Angular Tests
	- [ ] Change title to talk about 14.1 MeV with the STNG
	- [ ] Start with PSD plots at 3 angles
	- [ ] Then the resulting light output spectra (one plot)
	- [ ] Then the actual analysis
	- [ ] Emphasise use of STNG

# Chapter 4
- [ ] In general, stop referring to monoenergetic neutron fields. Refer to them as neutron fields with peak energy etc.
- [ ] AMANDE
	- [ ] Sphere in position at AMANDE
	- [ ] PSD plots at AMANDE
	- [ ] L plots at AMANDE (check they're ok)
	- [ ] Consider removing the paragraph that begins "The neutron light output spectra measured at IRSN AMANDE"
- [ ] PTB
	- [ ] Move mono after broad
	- [ ] Mono
		- [ ] Fix the hall picture to have white words
		- [ ] Add the detector picture
		- [ ] PSD plots (needs thought on how to present the 19 MeV stuff)

- EXPAC simulation software
- Brush up on dosimetry
- RaD-X papers on balloon flights (new mexico)
- Send francois the slides
- Thibaut for neutral net unfolding (very experienced)


- Download the different codes (there's one used by austrians)
- make some fake data for our flight (or flightradar)
- get the data from RaD-X

- Compare EXPAC and CARI7 at two latitudes, every 5 km or whatever

- Look at low and high LET for the balloon data
- EXPACS seems to work better with air pressure and cut off rigidity
- Use the two altitudes to get the total dose, from EXPACS, that we expect from the balloon, which will allow us to get a CPM to dose conversion factor

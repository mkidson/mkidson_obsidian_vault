Neutrons as secondary radiation from high energy charged particles pose a risk to both biological and electronic systems in workplace environments such as on aeroplanes, in spacecraft, and in proton therapy centres. Current technologies that allow for neutron spectrometry, such as Bonner spheres or liquid organic scintillators coupled to photomultiplier tubes, are not well-suited for measurements outside of laboratory environments. This work aims to develop new detector systems using plastic scintillators and silicon photomultipliers that are compact, robust to use outside of laboratory environments, and safe to use in a hand-held configuration. A prototype detector has been constructed and been used to measure high energy reference neutron fields, with signal processing handled offline. Work is ongoing to produce a detector system that processes signals in real time and can output a separate neutron and gamma ray dose rate, based on the energy deposited in the detector.

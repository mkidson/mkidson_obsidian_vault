- [ ] Bother Tom about the PSD circuit
	- [ ] Measure with CAEN box and tune the parameters
- [ ] Have a look at the M5 stack from Safecast to understand how to use it
- [ ] Also talk to Tom about the ADC chips he's used and if we can integrate them
- [ ] We want to save Q_s, Q_l, and time
- [ ] Also display count rate for n and gamma on the screen if possible
- [ ] Need a component hit list for this
	- [ ] PSU
		- [ ] We're using the temperature compensating circuit
		- [ ] Clint needs to make them
		- [ ] Then we need to adjust (as a first attempt we'll use the data from the docs)
			- [ ] 21.5 mV/C
	- [ ] SiPM board
		- [ ] Clint's board also works great, just need to check if it works for the larger sphere (25 mm)
		- [ ] If it works, at least 2 needed pls
	- [ ] PSD circuit board
		- [ ] Ask Tom to show me the circuit and I can start fiddlin
	- [ ] ADC
		- [ ] Also ask Tom for some SPI or I2C (pls SPI) devices that I can try out
	- [ ] Input to M5 stack
		- [ ] The Safecast code is complex as all shit. Idk if I want to delve into that, but we'll see.
		- [ ] There is also a micropython option. I'll have a look at that
		- [ ] Need to grab an M5 stack from Andy, unless Tanya has one for me

## [[Timeline for the n-gamma counter]]
- Main deadline is to take the detector to Paris mid October for Francois
- Before that, we'd like to maybe measure with it in September at iThemba (10-14 Sep)
- So by 5 Sep we should really have things ready.
- To get there

- [ ] Bother Tom about the PSD circuit
	- [ ] Measure with CAEN box and tune the parameters
- [ ] Have a look at the M5 stack from Safecast to understand how to use it
- [ ] Also talk to Tom about the ADC chips he's used and if we can integrate them
- [ ] We want to save Q_s, Q_l, and time
- [ ] Also display count rate for n and gamma on the screen if possible
- [ ] Need a component hit list for this
	- [ ] PSU
		- [ ] Clint's board works great
		- [ ] Need to produce at least 2 more
	- [ ] SiPM board
		- [ ] Clint's board also works great, just need to check if it works for the larger sphere (25 mm)
	- [ ] PSD circuit board
		- [ ] Ask Tom to show me the circuit and I can start fiddlin
	- [ ] ADC
		- [ ] Also ask Tom for some SPI or I2C (pls SPI) devices that I can try out
	- [ ] Input to M5 stack
		- [ ] The Safecast code is complex as all shit. Idk if I want to delve into that, but we'll see.

Using the above setup, a light output spectrum was measured for 14.1 MeV neutrons at the n-lab, with the beam flooding the detector. 

L-S spectra can be seen to have very little difference between them:

Separating the neutrons out using PSD, the neutron light output spectra can be seen to be practically identical:

Measuring the position of the recoil edge by differential Gaussian fitting, the positions were compared and were found to be within 1% of the 0 degree measurement. Note: I want to discuss the uncertainties here. I think they're mostly to do with the sigma from the fitting, but want to be sure.

The count rates for each angle were also recorded, shown below, and were found to be within 6% of the zero degree measurement.

# Improved light output resolution compared to traditional detector (cylinder on PMT)

Below is the Cs spectrum for each detector. Differentiating and fitting a Gaussian shows the edge resolution of the sphere to be slightly better than the cylinder:

Sphere sigma: 0.027 
Cylinder sigma: 0.035

That turns into (with $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$)

Sphere Cs edge resolution: 5.46 % 
Cylinder Cs edge resolution: 7.42 %

Doesn't show much but you can kind of squint and see a better resolution.

Below, left is the sphere and right is the cylinder. You can clearly see better separation of electron and proton loci, especially at the lower energies.

To quantify that, look at the figure of merit for 0.2 MeVee slices on the 5 MeV measurement

When looking at the neutron spectra, we can see that the sphere has a much sharper edge than the cylinder. You may say that this is because the light output is lower, but I'd expect it to be better at the same MeVee. We can also see at the low L values, the resolution of the alpha bump is much better for the sphere. Even the secondary recoil edge (5 MeVee for sphere) is much more obvious.

At 5 MeV, we see the better light output resolution is clear since the recoil edges are in the same place for both detectors.

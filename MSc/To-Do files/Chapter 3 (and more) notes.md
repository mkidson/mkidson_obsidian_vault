# Redo all plots with the new long integral length

- Small details that don't help the story
- Don't worry too much about copying e.g. the n-lab paper
- Be consistent with referring to elements
- Don't start sentences with symbols or acronyms
- Don't be nitpicky about your own work
- Save future work issues for that section
- Floating figures not referenced in the text
- Footnotes for negative comments maybe
- Check the Cs measurements upstairs and downstairs and if they're in the same position, use the nice one for all of them
- "we consider it acceptable when there isn't another option" for the 1 point calibration
- figure of CFD
- For the FoM optimisation, put an AmBe L-S spectrum with good and bad gate lengths
- Then show FoM plot for AmBe
- Then say how we optimised, not mentioning that it's done with AMANDE data
- Neutron cut should go down to the point that you're sure is separated, and then cut it all off below that
- Defining the Digital Light Output Parameter - Buffler Hutton
- Difference in L is not the SiPM thing necessarily, it's because of the long gate abruptly cutting off the pulse
- Maybe use the n-lab paper's PSD pulse plot in the background section
- Scale for the constructed detector system
- ylabel for the calibration plot should be Compton edge energy
- errorbars on whatever needs them (everything)
- n-lab can also include the angle characterisation
- < 5% isotropy

# Chapter 4
- High level comment leading into analysis in Ch 5
- Rethink the geometry images (Tanya has issues)
- Label the in-between ToF plots
- They're not response functions, just lineshapes
- n-lab now has the angular stuff so no need at AMANDE

# Chapter 5
- This then becomes the last chapter, including the unfolding
- Unfold monoenergetics


# One last measurement
- Many angles, showing light output edge, count rate, some other parameters
- Motivate that around the detector axis doesn't need to be measured because of the symmetry of the casing
- 0 to 180, 30 degree gaps

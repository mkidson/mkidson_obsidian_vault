# Redo all plots with the new long integral length

- Small details that don't help the story
- Don't worry too much about copying e.g. the n-lab paper
- Be consistent with referring to elements
- Don't start sentences with symbols or acronyms
- Don't be nitpicky about your own work
- Save future work issues for that section
- Maybe use the n-lab paper's PSD pulse plot in the background section
- Scale for the constructed detector system
- ylabel for the calibration plot should be Compton edge energy
- < 5% isotropy

# Chapter 4

# Chapter 5
- Checking ToF calibration
- Unfolded mono
	- Motivates using efficiency
- Simulation
	- Needs L vs E
	- show spectra (justify threshold)
	- efficiency
- Unfolding high energy mono
- Unfold AmBe
	- Focus on comparison to uncorrected


- This then becomes the last chapter, including the unfolding
- Unfold monoenergetics
- Defining the Digital Light Output Parameter - Buffler Hutton
- Difference in L is not the SiPM thing necessarily, it's because of the long gate abruptly cutting off the pulse

# Chapter 6
- cylinder comparison
	- Compare FoM at a given L value
# One last measurement
- Many angles, showing light output edge, count rate, some other parameters
- Motivate that around the detector axis doesn't need to be measured because of the symmetry of the casing
- 0 to 180, 30 degree gaps

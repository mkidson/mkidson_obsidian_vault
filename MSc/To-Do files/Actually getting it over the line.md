- [ ] Chapter 5
	- [x] Rework the order of the simulation section so the flow is better
	- [x] More intermediate figures
	- [x] Energy deposited by protons, carbons, alphas
	- [x] light output vs E
	- [x] Then L spectrum simulated before and after broadening
	- [x] Describe the broadening procedure and maybe a figure there?
		- [x] sigma as a function of E
	- [x] Include the fit parameters for the L vs E
	- [x] Try fix L vs E fit so that it doesn't go negative. Include lower energy responses (manual fitting?)
	- [x] Labels on the L spectra comparison simulation plot
	- [x] Andy and I agreed on using "best fit" because it was really done by eye but we don't want to say that
	- [x] PTB PIAF or just PIAF? PIAF is right but idk man
	- [x] Andy doesn't want "monoenergetic" neutron energy fields. 
	- [x] Ask tanya how the scaling factor works
	- [x] fix capitalisation in all figures
	- [x] remove references to the markers in captions, only in text
	- [ ] check uncertainties on PTB (and IRSN)
	- [x] Check for linebreaks
	- [x] Fix units on the vertical for all plots
	- [ ] Make brackets larger (latex it)
	- [x] neutron fields with monoenergetic peak energies
	- [x] last spell check
	- [x] finish acknowledgements

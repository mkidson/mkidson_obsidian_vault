- [ ] Chapter 5
	- [ ] Rework the order of the simulation section so the flow is better
	- [ ] More intermediate figures
	- [ ] Energy deposited by protons, carbons, alphas
	- [ ] light output vs E
	- [ ] Then L spectrum simulated before and after broadening
	- [ ] Describe the broadening procedure and maybe a figure there?
		- [ ] sigma as a function of E
	- [ ] Include the fit parameters for the L vs E
	- [ ] Try fix L vs E fit so that it doesn't go negative. Include lower energy responses (manual fitting?)
	- [ ] Labels on the L spectra comparison simulation plot
	- [ ] Andy and I agreed on using "best fit" because it was really done by eye but we don't want to say that

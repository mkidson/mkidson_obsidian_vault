Difference between the EJ-301 spectrum and the EJ-276 spectrum is shown below.

## So the data is:
- [x] L (calibrated) and S for AmBe measurement at n-lab. The cuts should also be included to recreate the neutron selection.
- [x] L (uncalibrated) and S for STNG measurements at the n-lab for angular comparisons. With cuts to reproduce neutron spectra.
	- [ ] Also has the T variable, which is the time from start of acquisition. It does have a rollover though so that needs to be mentioned in the README
- [x] Values and uncertainties for edge position and count rate for angular comparisons.
- [ ] L (calibrated) and S for all mono-energetic measurements at AMANDE and the 14.8 at PTB. PSD cuts including L threshold.
- [ ] L (calibrated), S, T_diff, T, and E for 19 MeV at PTB and all the cyclotron measurements. PSD cuts as well.
- [ ] The "response functions" as the bins and heights for the BIG figure in the thesis
- [ ] Also, the response functions as can be used in UMG (.rsp)
- [ ] L vs E for broad and monoenergetics. Also the model and the fit parameters
- [ ] Neutron detection efficiency from Geant4 and NRESP for the 25 mm sphere
- [ ] AmBe neutron L spectrum in the format to give to UMG, and the output from UMG for the refolded spectrum
- [ ] ISO, EJ-301, and EJ-276 unfolded AmBe neutron spectra (binned the same way)








## Maybe needed
 - [ ] Figure 3.8: Light output spectrum measured for a 137Cs radioisotopic gamma ray source with a 25 mm sphere of EJ-276 coupled to a SiPM. Shown is the spectrum, the derivative of that spectrum, a Gaussian function fit to the gradient, and the centroid value of the fitted Gaussian function.

 - [ ] Figure 5.4: Neutron detection efficiency as a function of incident neutron energy, calculated using simulation: NRESP for EJ-301 and Geant4 for EJ-276. The EJ-301 efficiency has been scaled to match EJ-276. A light output threshold of 2.00 MeVee was used for EJ-276, equating to 2.54 MeVee for EJ-301.

## Notes
- For neutron spectra, I think best to just have L (calibrated), S, T (uncalibrated), T (calibrated), E where possible. If not ToF then just L (calibrated), S.
- Should also include the cuts

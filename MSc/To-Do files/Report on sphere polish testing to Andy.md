The effect of the surface finish on spheres of EJ-276 on the light output, energy resolution, and PSD ability was tested for a selection of different scintillator wrapping techniques. Two identical spheres of EJ-276 with diameter 20 mm and a 6 mm flat spot milled into them were prepared, with the only difference being the surface finish: one was polished to a smooth finish while the other was left with the cut-marks as a result of the machining process.

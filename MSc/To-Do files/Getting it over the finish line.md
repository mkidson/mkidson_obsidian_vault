# Introduction
- [ ] References in the first section
- [ ] Round off the previous work and objectives of the current work (refer to jarvie)

# Neutron Spectroscopy Techniques
- [x] Reference for comparison of energy resolution: liquid to plastic scintillator
- [ ] Light output spectrum components image. Need a better version

# Development of the Detector System
- [x] Increase font size in CFD pulse plot
- [x] Font size in example PSD plots for bad integral length choices
- [x] Font size in integral length optimisation plots
- [x] Angular tests figure: make beam wider than detector
- [ ] Reference for the angular response requirement of the detector from Gael's document

# Measurements at neutron metrology facilities
- [ ] Angles and distances that the arms can cover at PTB PIAF tandetron
- [ ] Thickness of the Be target at PTB cyclotron
- [ ] Is energy resolution the right term when we get to unfolding?

# Characterisation of the detector system
- [ ] Verification of the tof calibration section needs thought on how to round it out and conclude with something.
- [ ] L vs E plot needs some work
- [ ] L vs E section might need more words but I'm not sure
- [ ] Unfolded AmBe plots increase font size
- [ ] What are the units on the vertical for the unfolded neutron energy spectrum?

# Comparison to a traditional detector system
- [ ] Need to properly think about the story in this section
- [ ] Lots of work of the example pulses plots

# Conclusion and recommendations
- [ ] Actually write it
- [ ]

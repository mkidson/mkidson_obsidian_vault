Linked to [[PhD/SANSA Bursary Application|SANSA Bursary Application]] 

- Find the link in my email to do the application. Needs financial statements from undergrad and a motivation letter. Best to mainly use the NRF one tbh.
- Due 30 September 2024.
- Need to find some literature of neutrons in space, maybe ask Elizabeth

[[Motivation for neutron spectrometry in space and aviation]]



# Cosmic rays
- What are cosmic rays?
- How do they produce radiation in the atmosphere and in space?
- What is the proportion of neutrons in both environments?
- What is the approximate dose rate comparison between space, aviation, and on the ground?
- Neutron RBE or something like that.

The space radiation environment is a complex mixture of particles of galactic (galactic cosmic rays GCRs) and solar (solar particle events SPEs) origin which have energies high enough to penetrate deep into matter, interacting by ordinary ionisation and through nuclear collisions. In these nuclear collisions both target and projectile fragmentation occurs, resulting in a cascade of secondary particles including neutrons. Neutrons are produced by two processes in practically two energy ranges: low energy neutrons around 1 MeV as evaporation products, and high energy neutrons originating as knock-on neutrons in peripheral collisions or in charge exchange reactions. Solar flares produce additional neutrons with energies ranging from thermal energies up to several GeV (Armstrong et al., 2001).

At or around sea level, the atmosphere does a great job of shielding against the neutrons and charged particles produced in these reactions. At regular aviation altitudes, however, we're not so lucky, with ***WOULD LIKE AN APPROXIMATE DOSE COMPARISON HERE***. The composition of the radiation fields at these altitudes has been shown to be about 40% neutrons (Goldhagen et. al., 2003)


# Neutron spectrometry at altitude and in space

- What are the technologies?
- What techniques do they typically rely on?
- What are the problems with the current technologies?

# What technologies do we plan to use
- New technology (SiPM, plastic scint, digital data acq)
- Benefits of each of those technologies
- Show the MSc work
- GEANT4

# Response functions
- Need to measure new ones for each detector system
- Want to use iThemba LABS for up to 120 MeV

# Research questions
- Test systems in space/aviation environments to try reproduce old results
- Improve on those results?
-

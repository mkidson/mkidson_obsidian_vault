## To-do

- [ ] Unfolding
- [ ] Try reassign events in S histograms by fitting
- [ ] [[Loot at seconds from first event for the weird locus at low S]]
- [ ] Find studies on SiPM nonlinearity
- [ ] [[PSD cut automations Something to do with the standard deviation etc.]]
- [ ] [[All 4 AMANDE energies simulate energy dep for sphere. Fully irradiated. With and without a broadening factor. Plotted with AMANDE data]]
- [ ] Example pulse of equal energy from all different detector shapes and PMs. Would be cool to show at some point.
- [ ] SiPMs in radiation environments. Look at research
- [ ] Change cfd to only look at a certain window. If we know the post trigger amount and acquisition window length, then we can choose a region where the trigger from the digitiser would be
- [ ] Redo the CFD optimisation that Angus does in his thesis. pg 36.
- [ ] Check the fraction of escaping recoils in cylinder compared to sphere
- [ ] [[Thesis structure and a plan for realising it]]
- [ ] Make final plots of things where possible
- [ ] Redo Cs simulation
- [ ] Ask about fluence for ToF data
- [ ] Check functional form of energy resolution against ToF sigma data
- [ ] Efficiency Uncertainty?
- [ ] Put the cylinder on the SiPMs
- [ ] Look into FPGA programming
- [ ] [[Quick investigation into SiPM temperature dependence]]
- [ ] Check the fraction of escaping recoils in cylinder compared to sphere
- [ ] Histograms should go to zero at the start


## In Progress

- [ ] [[Towards a usable workflow of data to results]]
- [ ] Uncertainty can be sigma/x where we compare it to the width of the edge of the L spectrum
- [ ] [[Let's get going on uncertainties]]
- [ ] [[Uncertainty on the E value for a given L edge position]]
- [ ] [[Unfold then apply efficiency curve]]
- [ ] [[0.1 MeVee structure in proton simulation only for sphere]]
- [ ] Compare to 0.3 MeVee threshold as alphas aren't in that region
- [ ] [[MSc/SANSA Bursary application|SANSA Bursary application]]
- [ ] [[SAIP 2024 Proceedings]] ^8fs028
- [ ] Make example plots of spectra and 2dhists for us to argue about, so we don't have to argue about them every single time.

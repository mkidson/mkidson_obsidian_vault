## To-do

- [ ] [[PSD cut automations Something to do with the standard deviation etc.]]
- [ ] SiPMs in radiation environments. Look at research
- [ ] Redo the CFD optimisation that Angus does in his thesis. pg 36.
- [ ] [[Quick investigation into SiPM temperature dependence]]


## In Progress

- [ ] [[Unfolding Process]]
- [ ] [[First Draft Feedback]]
- [ ] [[The weird unfolding]]
- [ ] [[Actually getting it over the line]]
- [ ] [[FPGA idea]]


## Complete

**Complete**
- [x] Ask tanya to check the UMG package bit, and the unfolding results. Also the paragraph at the end of the broad spectrum bit
- [x] [[Questions for Tanya]]

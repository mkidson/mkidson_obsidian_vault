## To-do

- [ ] Try reassign events in S histograms by fitting
- [ ] [[PSD cut automations Something to do with the standard deviation etc.]]
- [ ] Example pulse of equal energy from all different detector shapes and PMs. Would be cool to show at some point.
- [ ] SiPMs in radiation environments. Look at research
- [ ] Redo the CFD optimisation that Angus does in his thesis. pg 36.
- [ ] Ask about fluence for ToF data
- [ ] [[Quick investigation into SiPM temperature dependence]]
- [ ] [[Details on neutron energies in space]]
- [ ] [[Read up on Bonner sphere systems]]
- [ ] Unfolding efficiency correction and final neutron spectrum scaling needs a lot more thought. Shit looks too bad
- [ ] Compare 25 mm cylinder on 1 vs 4 SiPMs, with no backing material
- [ ] Make a design section that details the steps taken to finalise the design re: wrapping etc
- [ ] Neutron measurements are the next chapter, with IRSN and PTB facilities, then detailing measurements
- [ ] Include the cylinder on PMT measurements at AMANDE to compare to the system


## In Progress

- [ ] [[Towards a usable workflow of data to results]]
- [ ] Uncertainty can be sigma/x where we compare it to the width of the edge of the L spectrum
- [ ] [[0.1 MeVee structure in proton simulation only for sphere]]
- [ ] [[MSc/SANSA Bursary application|SANSA Bursary application]]
- [ ] [[Make example plots of spectra and 2dhists for us to argue about, so we don't have to argue about them every single time.]]
- [ ] [[Science Department funding application]]
- [ ] [[IRSN Funding]]
- [ ] [[Unfolding Process]]
- [ ] [[First Draft Feedback]]


## Complete

**Complete**
- [x] Introduce facilities, then separate by technique. Broad beam up to energy spectrum. Monos from IRSN and PTB pointing towards simulation
- [x] [[Getting it over the finish line]]
- [x] [[Chapter 3 (and more) notes]]
- [x] [[Tanya Meeting 10-01-25]]

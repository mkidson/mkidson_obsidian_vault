# Abstract

Fast neutron fields are present in aviation, space, radiotherapy, and nuclear research environments. Characterisation and continuous monitoring are required for risk assessment and
workplace dosimetry as neutrons present particular radiation protection challenges. These
neutron fields are often coupled with gamma ray fields, cover a large range in energy and
intensity, and have variable directional characteristics. Existing technologies for out-of-
laboratory measurements largely rely on moderator-based systems, which tend to be bulky,
have inflexible analyses, and have high associated costs. A compact detector system has
been developed at the University of Cape Town for fast neutron spectrometry and dosimetry
based on plastic scintillators, silicon photomultipliers, and digital data acquisition.

This work will present the characterisation and calibration of a detector system suitable
for neutron measurements up to 20 MeV comprised of an EJ-276 scintillator (Eljen) in a
novel spherical geometry, MICROFC-60035 silicon photomultiplier (onsemi), and DT5370
digitiser (CAEN). Measurements of well-characterised fast neutron fields were made at the
n-lab, University of Cape Town, and international reference facilities AMANDE (IRSN,
France) and PIAF (PTB, Germany). Detector response functions were measured between
1.0 MeV and 16.0 MeV using time-of-flight analyses, and Geant4 simulations of the detector
system were used to determine the neutron detection efficiency. Neutron fluence spectra of
known fields were then unfolded using the efficiency-corrected detector response functions,
demonstrating the capabilities of such a device as a neutron spectrometer.

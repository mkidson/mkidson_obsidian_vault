# Introduction

Fast neutrons as secondary radiation from high energy charged particles are present in many environments. They have been shown to be damaging to both humans and electronics, so the characterisation and monitoring of fast neutron fields is of great importance. In many applications, this is done with Bonner sphere systems; proportional counters that get surrounded by increasingly thicker shielding to moderate the neutrons, thus counting the neutrons at different energies ***READ UP ON BONNER SPHERES***. These systems work well to measure the

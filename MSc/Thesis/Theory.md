# Theory
## Scintillation
The detection of charged particles is a problem that has been solved a number of times in a number of different ways. Scintillation detectors work by taking advantage of the ability of charged particles to continuously deposit kinetic energy in a material as they pass through it, as well as the ability of some materials to exhibit fluorescence when excited. This fluorescence is emitted at optical wavelengths, making it much easier to measure than, say, a gamma or x-ray. The energy of the ionising particle is even able to measured, as the amount of scintillation photons produced is related to the energy deposited by the charged particle, as well as its charge-to-mass ratio.

# Design
The EJ-276 was machined into a sphere with diameter 25 mm. A flat spot was milled on the sphere with the diameter of 9 mm. See the diagram below. This piece of scintillator was wrapped in PTFE tape (Teflon, plumber's tape, etc) to create a diffuse, white wrapping. This allows for any light produced in the scintillator that reaches the edges to be diffused, giving it a better chance of reaching the photomultiplier. This is in contrast to having a reflective wrapping, as tends to be done for the face of cylindrical scintillators that sits opposite the photomultiplier. 

The scintillator was then wrapped in a layer of tinfoil, in order to support the more flimsy PTFE tape and provide an opaque backing for better diffuse reflection rather than transmission. After wrapping, the scintillator was placed on the 6 mm x 6 mm SiPM sensor after applying EJ-500

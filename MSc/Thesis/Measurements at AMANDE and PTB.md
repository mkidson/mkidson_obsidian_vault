# Measurements
## PTB PIAF
The creation of response functions for unfolding requires a source of monoenergetic neutrons covering a wide range of energies, preferably with regular spacing between each energy. Instead of producing monoenergetic neutrons at all the required energies, time-of-flight was used to determine the energies of neutrons from a broad beam neutron source, after which events were split up according to their energy to determine their light output responses. Below is a description of the process by which the neutron energy is calculated.

### Time of Flight

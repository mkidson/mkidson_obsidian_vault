# Response functions
The measured light output response for the broad-beam neutron source at PTB represents the response from neutrons of all energies from ~ 1 MeV to ~ 16.5 MeV. These responses are made up of many individual points of light output corresponding to an incident neutron. Time-of-flight provides the energy of the incident neutron, providing a way to separate the events, and thus the light output spectra, according to the energy of the incident neutron. Of course, it would be impossible to select neutrons of a single energy for each light output response, so bins of neutron energy are chosen. The smaller the width of the bins, the better the eventual unfolding will be as it will have higher "resolution" energy data to work with.

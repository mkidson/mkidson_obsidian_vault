# Introduction
Neutrons as secondary radiation from high energy charged particles are present in many environments and pose a great risk biologically and to electronics and machinery. Two of those environments are at aviation altitudes, due to spallation in the atmosphere from cosmic rays, and in proton therapy centres, where interactions of the protons with the materials present result in fast neutrons. The characterisation of these fields using a neutron spectrometer is clearly of great importance.

In both these cases, the energy spectrum of the neutrons is dominated by two peaks. One is on the order of 1 MeV, while the other is around 100 MeV. For a neutron spectrometer to suit the application of characterisation and monitoring of these fields, it must be sensitive over the entire range. For a Bonner sphere-based detector system, this requires a large number of repeat measurements with different moderating spheres, and a complicated analysis. Consequently, a logical choice for this application would be organic scintillator-based detectors. Industry standard scintillators like the liquid NE213/EJ-301 are capable of neutron-gamma ray pulse shape discrimination and are sensitive to a wide range of incident neutron energies, but since they need to be kept in glass containers and are made from extremely toxic and dangerous materials, they don't lend themselves to applications outside of strict laboratory environments. This along with the fact that they are usually coupled with a photomultiplier tube that is fragile and operates at ~1000 V, mean that liquid organic scintillators are also not a great choice for this application.

This work aims to explore three new technologies and how they can be used to create new detectors for neutron spectrometry that are suitable for use in extreme conditions, are much safer to handle, and hopefully lead to more compact detector systems for collaboration with Cosmic on air.

# Introduction
Neutrons as secondary radiation from high energy charged particles are present in many environments and pose a great risk biologically and to electronics and machinery. Two of those environments are at aviation altitudes, due to spallation in the atmosphere from cosmic rays, and in proton therapy centres, where interactions of the protons with the materials present result in fast neutrons. The characterisation of these fields using a neutron spectrometer is clearly of great importance.

In both these cases, the energy spectrum of the neutrons is dominated by two peaks. One is on the order of 1 MeV, while the other is around 100 MeV. For a neutron spectrometer to suit the application of characterisation and monitoring of these fields, it must be sensitive over the entire range. For a Bonner sphere-based detector system, this requires a large number of repeat measurements with different moderating spheres, and a complicated analysis. Consequently, a logical choice for this application would be organic scintillator-based detectors. They are generally capable of neutron-gamma ray pulse shape discrimination and are sensitive to a wide range of incident neutron energies
